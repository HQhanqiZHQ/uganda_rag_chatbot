~ M. bovis is the most common cause of TB in livestock. Transmission from cattle to humans is through consumption or contact with infected milk and unpasteurized dairy products, contaminated water (2).
~ It can be transmitted directly from person-to-person by coughing or sneezing droplets containing the bacteria. The organism survives on surfaces for several days where it is airborne for about 30 minutes.
~ Mycobacterium tuberculosis and M. africanum are most commonly transmitted from person-to-person by coughing or sneezing droplets containing the bacteria (1).
~ Unpasteurized milk may also transmit TB to humans.
~ Direct contact with infected persons can lead to infection, especially for those who live together and are close contacts of an infectious person (3)

~ Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (e.g. M. tuberculosis,
~ M. bovis, M. avium, M. africanum and M. Microti)
~ M. tuberculosis is the commonest cause of tuberculosis
~ Transmission by droplet inhalation (cough from a patient with open pulmonary TB); can also be through drinking unpasteurised milk, especially M.bovis

General symptoms
~ Fevers especially in the evening, ~ excessive night sweats
~ Weight loss and loss of appetite

Pulmonary Tb
~ Chronic cough of >2 weeks (however, in HIV settings, cough of any duration)
~ Chest pain, purulent sputum occasionally blood-stained, shortness of breath

Extrapulmonary Tb
~ Lymphnode TB: Localized enlargement of lymph nodes depending on the site affected (commonly neck)
~ Pleural or pericardial effusion
~ Abdominal TB: ascites and abdominal pain
~ TB meningitis: subacute meningitis (headache, alteration of consciousness)
~ Bone or joint TB: swelling and deformity Complications
~ Massive haemoptysis - coughing up >250 mL blood per episode
~ Spontaneous pneumothorax and pleural effusion
~ TB pericarditis, TB meningitis, TB peritonitis ~ Bone TB: can be TB spine with gibbus, TB joints with deformity)
~ Respiratory failure

Response:
Tuberculosis is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex.

Response:
The symptoms of tuberculosis are usually mild and nonspecific. These include fever, night sweats, weight loss, fatigue, anorexia, abdominal pain (with peritoneal TB), chest pains (with pleural effusion) or a persistent cough with blood in the sputum (suggestive of pulmonary Tb).

Response:
The most common symptoms of tuberculosis are fever, night sweats, weight loss and fatigue. These can also be present in other diseases which may be confused for tuberculosis.

Response:
Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium Tuberculosis. It mainly affects the lungs, but it can spread to any part of the body through the bloodstream. The symptoms are usually mild and nonspecific. These include fever, night sweats, weight loss, fatigue, anorexia, abdominal pain (with peritoneal TB), chest pains (with pleural effusion) or a persistent cough with blood in the sputum (suggestive of pulmonary Tb).
