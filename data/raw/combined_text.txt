# Uganda Clinical Guidelines 2023 National Guidelines For Management Of Common Health Conditions Foreword

The overall goal of Uganda's health system is to provide accessible, equitable and quality services to the population, in order to promote a healthy and productive life, which is a necessary factor for achieving socio-economic growth and national development.

Currently, the health system is faced with multiple challenges that include a high burden of infectious diseases that remain major causes of morbidity and mortality, such as HIV, malaria, tuberculosis, lower respiratory tract infections, malnutrition and meningitis. In addition, new threats keep emerging, for example, epidemics of hepatitis B, yellow fever, haemorrhagic fevers, COVID-19 and nodding disease. The increase of non-communicable conditions including diabetes, hypertension, heart diseases, cancer and mental disorders complicates the scenario. The push towards universal health coverage, including universal access to AntiRetroviral Therapy (ART) and particular attention to neonatal, child, adolescent and maternal health, is also placing more demands on a system with limited resources. To respond appropriately, the health system has to ensure high standards of quality and efficiency in service delivery. The Uganda Clinical Guidelines manual helps to achieve these standards by presenting updated, practical, and useful information on the diagnosis and management of common health conditions in Uganda. It also provides a rational basis for an efficient procurement and supply system that ensures the availability of safe, efficacious, quality medicines and health supplies.

The guidelines are based on principles of scientific evidence, cost effectiveness and prioritization of conditions to maximize the health benefit with limited resources. The regular update of clinical guidelines and essential medicines lists is one of the key interventions in the Health Sector Development Plan 2015-2020, to promote the appropriate use of health products and technologies.

I wish to thank all the members of the Ministry of Health Update Task Force, government parastatals, medical consultants, district health workers, the private sector, the Uganda Reproductive Maternal Child and Adolescent Health Improvement Project (URMCHIP) and development partners for their immense input in developing the 2023 UCG edition. 

Finally, I thank the consultancy firm, Zenith Solutions Limited, that coordinated the overall inputs that led to the successful development of this book.

# Preface

The Uganda Clinical Guidelines (UCG) evolved from the National Standard Treatment Guidelines 1993, which were the first of the type published in Uganda. Before then, individual guidelines existed to manage a limited number of specific conditions. The purpose of national standard treatment guidelines is to provide evidence-based, practical and implementable guidance to prescribers to provide the most cost-effective and affordable treatment of priority health conditions in a country. Together with the Practical Guidelines for Dispensing at Lower/ Higher Health Facility Level, which provide information about medicine characteristics, administration, and side effects, the UCG is designed as a practical tool to support daily clinical practice by providing a reliable reference for health workers on appropriate management of Uganda's common health conditions. It also gives health managers a reference tool to assess and measure service quality.

The guidelines are also the basis for the formulation of the essential medicines and health supplies list of Uganda (EMHSLU), which is used to guide supply and procurement. This allows for more efficient use of limited resources to improve rational prescribing. The treatments described in the UCG are the nationally recognised standard treatments, and in many cases, they are derived from those recommended in the Ministry of Health Vertical Programmes, World Health Organisation, and other international guidelines. The guidelines have been reviewed and updated through a three-month process involving extensive consultations with public health programs staff, medical experts and health workers of all cadres and various health development partners.

As medicine is an ever-evolving field, this manual is to be used for guidance, but cannot replace clinical judgement in individual cases.

The Ministry of Health and all those involved in updating the UCG sincerely hope that the manual will make a significant contribution to ongoing improvements in national therapeutic services and medicines utilisation.

Dr. Henry G. Mwebesa

The UCG aims to provide summarized easy-to-use, practical, complete and useful information on how to quickly and correctly diagnose and manage common conditions you are likely to encounter. This will ensure that patients receive the best possible clinical services and obtain prompt and effective relief from or cure of their complaint, thereby making the most appropriate use of scarce diagnostic and clinical resources, including medicines. It should, however, be emphasised that the UCG does not replace or substitute available textbooks on the subject.

## Why Is The Ucg Necessary?

Medicine is an ever-evolving and expanding field in terms of needs and knowledge. The UCG helps the country to prioritize and effectively use limited resources by guiding the procurement system to ensure the availability of the most needed medicines and supplies.

In the context of new knowledge and changing priorities, as a tool, 

![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png) the UCG assists health workers in their daily practice by providing information in an easy-to-follow and practical format.

How do I use the UCG?

First of all, familiarize yourself with it. Check the table of contents and see how the chapters are arranged and organized.

## New Feature

The order of chapters has been maintained as in the previous versions. However, new chapters have been introduced, namely, self-care, management of hypoxia and COVID-19. The Palliative Care section has been expounded with more clarity. For the first time a purely herbal preparation with selenium has been included for management of stress. The snake bite section has been enriched with photographs of the common virulent snakes found in Uganda, to ease identification and thus more accurate intervention and management.

Most chapters are organised by disease monographs, arranged either in alphabetical order or another logical order (e.g., according to occurrence of disease progression). However, some chapters are organised according to syndrome or symptoms (e.g., child health, palliative care, oncology, sexually transmitted infections, emergencies and trauma), while TB and HIV are presented as individual sub-chapters.

XLV
New Feature The chapters Covid -19, Self-care and Hypoxia management have been added with focus on primary care (prevention and early recognition of symptoms).

Disease monographs are organized in the order of: definition, cause/ risk factors, clinical features and complications, differential diagnosis, investigations, management, and prevention.

![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png)

![2_image_2.png](2_image_2.png)

Palliative care ladder has been introduced to make it easier for pain assessment. Treatments are presented in logical order from non-pharmacological to pharmacological, from the lower to the higher level of care. Where 

![2_image_3.png](2_image_3.png) possible, alternatives and second-line options have been presented, as well as referral criteria.

Medicines are presented by their generic name, in **bold.** Unless otherwise specified, dosages are for adults and via oral route. Children's dosages are added whenever indicated, as well as duration and other instructions. The level of care (LOC) is an important feature; it provides information about the level at which the condition can be appropriately managed. Often, treatment can be initiated at lower level, but the patient needs to be referred for further management, or for second-line treatment, or for complications. For antibiotics, it is recommended that treatment can be initiated in some cases awaiting laboratory results. HC1-4 refers to health centres of different levels (with HC1 being the community level), H to general hospital, RR to regional referral hospital, and NR to national referral hospital.

After familiarizing yourself with it, try using it! Practice finding conditions and looking them up to see how they are managed, using either the table of contents at the beginning or the index at the end.

Read all the introductory sections. They will give you useful advice for your daily practice. There is always something new to learn or to be reminded of.

Use it in your daily practice. The UCG is designed as a simple reference manual to keep at your work station, where you can consult it any time. Using it in front of patients and colleagues will show that you care deeply about the quality of your work, and it will provide good examples to other health workers.

The UCG cannot replace health workers' knowledge and skills; like your 

![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)

thermometer and stethoscope, it is a tool to help improve clinical practice by providing a quick and easily available summary of the recommended management of common health conditions.

What is the difference between the UCG and a textbook?

The UCG gives a summary of recommendations for managing priority conditions in Uganda. It does not provide extensive or in-depth information about all diseases and all treatments available in the world. Conditions have been selected based on their prevalence in the country and their impact on the population's health status. Treatments have been selected based on the following criteria:
Scientific evidence: recommendations are evidence-based, from international literature and local experts. For example, the situation analysis on antimicrobial resistance in Uganda conducted by the National Academy of Sciences was used to guide the choice of antibiotic treatments.

Cost-effectiveness:treatments have been selected based on their effectiveness, but also their affordability, to get the best "value for money", 
meaning the maximum benefit with the limited resources available. For example, a liver transplant is a very effective way to treat terminal cirrhosis, but it is definitely not affordable—money is better invested in treating patients with chronic hepatitis B!

What has changed compared to the previous edition?

~ There are more chapters as explained before. ~ The management sections have been re-edited to be more user-friendly, using the suggestions collected during a user survey.

~ Information on new diseases has been added, following new epidemics and public health priorities (e.g., viral haemorrhagic fevers, Covid-19, yellow fever, nodding disease, sickle cell disease, newborn illnesses).

~ More attention has been paid to non-communicable chronic diseases; for example, stroke and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and sections on diabetes, hypertension, asthma and mental conditions including diseases of elderly and dementia have been expanded.

~ Recommendations have been aligned with the most recent national and international guidelines related to ART, TB, malaria, IMNCI, IMPAC, mhGAP (see the list of references in Appendix 4).

~ Medications have been added or deleted and level of care has changed according to recent evidence and national policies.

~ Skin management of Albinos using a sunscreen protection product has been included under the dermatological section.

~ The essential medicines list has been removed from this edition to make the book pocket friendly.

What about the Essential Medicines and Health Supply List (EMHSLU)?

The essential medicines list has been removed from this edition to make the book pocket friendly. Always refer to the separate EMHSLU. 

To implement the recommendations in the UCG, the medicines listed in 

![5_image_0.png](5_image_0.png) the EMHSLU have to be procured and distributed in adequate quantity. This is why the procurement and supply system plays a fundamental role in the provision of quality healthcare. The EMHSLU has all the medicines recommended in the UCG, with specification of the level of care (LOC) at which they can start being used, but it also has additional "specialty" medicines, which are items used at referral level (regional or national) or in the context of specialized services. They may not be included in the UCG, which focus more on primary care, but are still part of the list because they need to be procured to ensure the provision of a wider range of services at secondary and tertiary levels. In the context of limited resources, it is very important to learn to prioritize medicines for procurement: this is reflected by the vital, essential, necessary (VEN) classification in the EMHSLU, introduced in 2012.

L
Medicines are classified into three categories according to health impact:
V: vital medicines are potentially life-saving, and lack of availability would cause serious harm and side effects. These must ALWAYS be available—for example insulin, metformin, most antibiotics, first-line antimalarials, some anti-epileptics, and parenteral diuretics.

E: essential medicines are important; they are used to treat common illnesses that are maybe less severe but still significant. They are not absolutely needed for the provision of basic health care (e.g., anti-helminthics, pain killers).

N: necessary (or sometimes called non-essential) medicines are used for minor or self-limiting illnesses, or may have a limited efficacy, or a higher cost compared to the benefit.

Every effort has to be made to ensure health facilities do not suffer stock-outs of VITAL MEDICINES. AWaRe classification The WHO AWaRe classification was used to describe overall antibiotic use as assessed by the variation between use of Access, Watch, and Reserve antibiotics. 

Why is a laboratory test menu in the appendix?

Laboratory is an important tool in supporting the diagnosis and management of various conditions. Tests are listed according to the level at which they can be performed, in order to inform health workers about the available diagnostics at each level for the suspected condition and guide on managemeent or referral decisions.
# Primary Health Care

Definition Primary healthcare is **essential healthcare** based on practical, scientifically sound and socially acceptable methods and technologies. Primary healthcare should be universally **accessible** 
to individuals and families **in the community** through their full participation and at a cost that the community and country can afford in the spirit of **self-reliance** and **self-determination.**
Primary healthcare forms an integral part of both the country's health system, of which it is the main focus, and of the community's overall social and economic development.

Primary healthcare brings healthcare as close as possible to where people live and work and is the community's first level of contact with the national health system.

"Primary health care is the key to the attainment of the goal of Health for All."
—Declaration of Alma-Ata International Conference on Primary Health Care, 

![0_image_0.png](0_image_0.png)

Alma-Ata, USSR, 6–12 September 1978 How to diagnose and treat in primary care The principles of healthcare are the same wherever it takes place.

"Listen to the patient; he is telling you the diagnosis"
—Sir William Osler, MD, 1849–1919.

Communication skills in the consultation room Good communication skills are essential for making a correct diagnosis and 

![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)

for explaining or counselling on the illness, its treatment, and prevention of future illness.

At the beginning of the consultation, use open questions, which allow 

![1_image_1.png](1_image_1.png) the patient to express him or herself freely, listen without interrupting, and give him or her the chance to share their interpretations, fears and worries.

## The Golden Minute

The golden 60 seconds at the start of the consultation is eliciting ideas, concerns and expectations without interrupting.

Move to more specific questions later, to ask for further details and clarifications.

The Seven Steps in a Primary Care Consultation

## Greet

- Greet and welcome the patient. Ensure adequate space and privacy!

02

![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)

## Look

- Observe the patient as he/she walks into your room for degree or state of illness. Look for danger signs and act immediately if necessary

![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png)

## Listen

- Ask about the main complaint or complaints, establish duration, and explore each symptom asking relevant questions - Briefly ask about previous medical history, other past or present illnesses and current or recent medications

04

![2_image_2.png](2_image_2.png)

Examine
- Perform a complete medical examination, focused on but not limited to the complaints

05

![2_image_3.png](2_image_3.png)

## Suspect Diagnosis

- Write your findings, and think about possible diagnosis and differentials Test
- Request tests to confirm or exclude possible diagnosis

07

![2_image_4.png](2_image_4.png)

Treat
- Conclude on a diagnosis and decide on the treatment, if needed - Explain diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up to the patient - Give counselling and advice as appropriate

## New Feature

Introduced a section on self-care interventions for sexual and reproductive health (SRH), in the categories of self-awareness, self-testing and self-management, across the various health areas of Antenatal Care, Family Planning, HIV and STIs and post abortion care. WHO defines self-care as the ability of individuals, families and communities to promote health, prevent disease, maintain health, and cope with illness and disability with or without the support of a healthcare provider. The Ministry of Health developed the National Guideline on Self-Care Interventions for SRH. For details refer to the current guidelines

## Chronic Care

~ Health workers are faced with an increasing number of chronic diseases and conditions that require additional attention, such as hypertension, chronic heart problems, diabetes, cancers, mental conditions, HIV/AIDS, and TB.

~ Communication is even more important to:
~ Find out the duration of the symptoms, previous diagnosis, previous or current treatments and impact on daily life
~ Explain the nature and management of the condition to the patient and counsel on lifestyle and adjustment
~ Chronic diseases require long-term (sometimes lifelong) follow-up and treatment:
~ Counsel and advise the patient on the importance of follow- up and treatment adherence
~ Set up a system for scheduling appointments (on the model of HIV care!)
~ At each monitoring visit, determine whether the patient's condition is improving, stable, or deteriorating and assess whether patients are taking prescribed treatments properly (the right medicines, in the right doses, at the right time). Try to be consistent in prescribing and change the regimen only if it is not working or has side effects. If a treatment is working and well tolerated, maintain it!

~ Counsel and motivate the patient to follow lifestyle recommendations, including selfcare.

~ Assess the need for further support (e.g., pain management, counselling, etc.)
~ A chronic care system requires collaboration among and integration of all levels of healthcare
~ Higher levels of care may be responsible for initial diagnosis and prescription of treatment and periodic reviews and re-assessment in case of problems or complications
~ Lower levels of care (including the community) may be responsible for routine follow-up, counselling and education, medication refills and prompt and early referral in case of problems.

## Appropriate Medicines Use

According to WHO, "Rational [appropriate] use of medicines requires that patients receive medications appropriate to their clinical needs, in doses that meet their own individual requirements, for an adequate period of time, and at the lowest cost to them and their community".

Inappropriate medicine use can not only harm the patient, but by wasting resources, may limit the possibility of other people accessing healthcare! Both health workers and patients have an important role to play in ensuring appropriate use by:
~ Prescribing (and taking) medicines ONLY when they are needed
~ Avoiding giving unnecessary multiple medications to satisfy patients' demands or for financial gain LV
~ Avoiding expensive alternative or second-line medications when an effective and inexpensive first-line is available
~ Avoiding injections when oral treatment is perfectly adequate
~ Ensuring that the correct dose and duration of treatment is prescribed, especially for antibiotics, to avoid resistance
~ Providing adequate information and counselling to the patient to ensure adherence with instructions.

## Antimicrobial Resistance (Amr)

According to the WHO definition "Antimicrobial resistance occurs when microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites change in ways that render the medications used to cure the infections they cause ineffective. Antimicrobial resistance is facilitated by the inappropriate use of medicines, for example, when taking substandard doses or not finishing a prescribed course of treatment. 

Low-quality medicines, wrong prescriptions and poor infection prevention and control also encourage the development and spread of drug resistance". The problem of AMR is a serious threat for the modern world:
~ The resistance of malaria parasites has caused several changes in antimalarial regimens in the last 15 years
~ MDR-TB (multi-drug resistant tuberculosis) is spreading and requires long and complex treatments
~ HIV resistance is a serious concern, especially after longterm treatment ~ AMR is spreading and, in some cases, commonly used antimicrobials are not as effective as before
~ Antimicrobial resistance amomg bacteria other than TB 
and fungi (moulds and yeasts) that affect the immune-compromised is evolving, spreading and responsible for death from sepsis in general and high dependency units.

LVI 
Inappropriae use of antibiotics (in human medicine but also in animal agriculture), poor quality products and ineffective infection control measures are all contributing factors. We are seriously at risk of finding ourselves in a situation with no affordable antimicrobial available to cure common and dangerous infections.

It is URGENT that both health workers and patients become aware of the problem and start acting by:
~ Using antimicrobials only when it is really necessary and according to recommendations (e.g. not for simple viral infections!)
~ Avoiding self-prescription of antibiotics
~ Avoiding using last generation and broad spectrum antibiotics as first-line treatment
~ Prescribing correct dosages for the correct duration and ensuring adherence to the prescription
~ Practising strict measures of infection control in health facilities
~ Improving hygiene and sanitation in the community, thereby reducing the circulation of germs.

AWaRE
~ WHO has further introduced the AWaRE classification to guide prescribers during prescribing of antibiotics. The major focus of AWaRe approach is to reduce on the increasing antimicrobial resistance.

~ The principal of AWaRe prescribing is based on Access, Watch, Reserve.

~ Prescribers are encouraged to adhere to the above.

## Prescribing Guidelines

The current PGD (Practical Guidelines for Dispensing at Lower/ Higher Level Health Facilities), provide comprehensive information about how to prescribe and dispense the medicines listed in the EMHSLU and UCG 
2023. Carefully consider the following key questions before writing any prescription:

|------------|---|

Prescribing placebos Avoid placebos whenever possible. Instead, spend some time reassuring 

![9_image_0.png](9_image_0.png)

and educating the patient. Use home remedies when possible (e.g., honey for cough in adults and children above 1 year).

## Prescription Writing

A wrong prescription is very risky for you and your patient.

| PRESCRIPTION WRITING RULES ~ Write all prescriptions legibly in ink ~ Poor writing may lead to errors in interpretation by  the dispenser, which may have harmful and possibly  life-threatening consequences for the patient   |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Unclear, incomplete, or inaccurate prescriptions are very dangerous for the patient. To avoid problems, follow the guidance below in writing your prescriptions:

| PRESCRIPTION WRITING RULES ~ Write the full name, age, gender and address of the patient,  then sign and date the prescription form ~ All prescriptions should clearly indicate the name and address  of the prescriber and of the facility ~ A PRESCRIPTION IS A LEGAL DOCUMENT ~ Write the name of the medicine or preparation using its full  generic name. ~ Unofficial abbreviations, trade names, and obsolete names  should not be used. ~ State the strength of the medicine prescribed where relevant: ~ Quantities of one gram or more should be written as 1g,  2.5g, 10g, and so on ~ Quantities <1g but >1mg should be expressed in milligrams rather than grams, for example, 500mg and not  0.5g ~ Quantities <1mg should be expressed in micrograms and  not in mg, for example, 100 micrograms rather than 0.1  mg or 100 mcg ~ If decimal figures are used, always write a zero in front  of the decimal point where there is no other figure, for  example 0.5 ml and not .5 ml ~ Always state dose regimen in full: - Dose size, Dose frequency, Duration of treatment ~ The quantity to be dispensed is calculated from the regimen. ~ For example, doxycycline 100 mg every 12 hours for 7  days = to be dispensed: 14 tablets of 100 mg. ~ For in-patients, clearly state the route of administration  and specify time of administration, if relevant   |
|---|

## Prescription Writing Rules

~ Avoid use of instructions like "prn" or "to be used/taken as required". Indicate a suitable dose frequency instead
~ In the few cases where "as required" is appropriate, always state the actual quantity of the medicine to be supplied, when to take it and maximum amount
~ Where relevant, always remember to include on the prescription any special instructions necessary for the correct use of a medicine or preparation, for example "before food" or "apply sparingly".

Controlled medicine prescriptions These medicines are covered by the provisions of the National Drug Policy and Authority Act 1993, which should be consulted for details of the appropriate legal requirements as stipulated. Medicines covered by the Act and appear in the UCG 2023 or EMHSLU 2023 include:
~ Morphine injection
~ Morphine oral solution
~ Papaveretum + hyoscine injection
~ Pethidine injection
~ Codeine 
~ Tramadol
~ Diazepam injection These are all medicines of potential abuse that may result in dependence. All procedures involving them should be carefully recorded in the appropriate record books. They may only be prescribed by authorised prescribers who must observe the following legal requirements:
~ Prescriptions must be in the prescriber's own handwriting, with a signature, date and the prescriber's address
~ Prescriptions must state the name and address of the patient
~ Prescriptions must state the total amount of the product to be supplied in words and figures
~ It is an offence for a prescriber to issue and for a pharmacy to dispense prescriptions for controlled medicines unless they are in full compliance with the requirements of the law.

## Notes

![12_Image_0.Png](12_Image_0.Png)

 Specialised palliative care nurses and clinical officers are authorised to prescribe oral morphine and other medicines used in palliative care.

 Morphine rarely causes psychological dependence when prescribed for severe pain.

 In certain exceptional circumstances, senior nurses in charge of departments, wards or theatres and midwives may also obtain and administer certain specified controlled medicines. Consult the relevant sections of the Act for details of the appropriate legal requirements in each case.

 Hospital in-patient prescriptions written on treatment cards or case sheets and signed/dated by the person administering the medicine are considered as compliant under the Act.

## Prescribing In Children And The Elderly

In these guidelines, paediatric medicine doses are usually given according to body weight and not age, and are therefore expressed as mg/kg.

The main reason for this is that children of the same age may vary significantly in weight. Thus, it is safer and more accurate to prescribe medicines according to body weight. Moreover, this should encourage the good practice of weighing children whenever possible.

However, as a guide to prescribing by weight when a weighing scale is not available, the weight-for-age charts at the end of Chapter 17 can be used as an estimate for children from 1-24 months and 2-15 years, respectively. Always use lean/ideal body weight for children who are overweight/obese to avoid giving them overdoses.

Note: Paediatric doses calculated using mg/kg should not exceed the normal adult dose.

In the case of some medicines that have a wide therapeutic range and a good safety profile, dosages are given for age ranges for easy reference. Prescriptions in the elderly also need additional attention because the elderly are more prone to side effects; they are more likely to take several medications (polypharmacy) with possible interactions, and they often have co-morbidities that can affect their response to medicines. Reduced doses and careful monitoring are always advised, and specific warnings have been added for some medicines.

Medicine interactions Before prescribing any medicine, take care to avoid problems of interactions with other medicines by obtaining details of any other medication that the patient is taking, whether the medication is:
~ Also prescribed at the same time
~ Previously prescribed by another prescriber for the same or another condition and currently being taken by the patient
~ Purchased or otherwise obtained by the patient for the purposes of self-medication at home.

Note on interactions with alcohol. If a prescribed medicine interacts with alcohol (for example, metronidazole, diazepam, anti-diabetic 

![14_image_0.png](14_image_0.png)

medicines, and tricyclic antidepressants), caution the patient to avoid taking alcoholic drinks during the course of treatment and for 48 hours afterwards.

Patient counselling This vital part of patient management is often neglected with potentially serious consequences. Although counselling the patient may take time, if done systematically, it should only take a few minutes and could make the difference between treatment success and failure.

Include the following key components when counselling the patient:
~ Explain the diagnosis and the likely cause of the disease or condition and discuss the proposed approach to treatment
~ Describe the prescribed medicine therapy in detail including:
 Medicine name Function of the medicine Dose regimen (size, frequency, duration)
 Any additional instructions on correct use or storage of the medicine Any likely side effects and what to do if they occur Advise on important medicine interactions (including with alcohol)
~ Give advice on how to contribute to the success of the treatment (for example, rest, diet, fluids and other lifestyle changes) and how to avoid the same problem in future
~ Ensure the patient or caretaker fully understands the information and advice provided—ask him or her to repeat key points
~ For health conditions that require self-care, proper advice should be given to the patient on self-awareness, self-testing and self-management.

 Ensure the patient is satisfied with the proposed treatment and has an opportunity to raise any problems or queries with you.

![0_image_0.png](0_image_0.png)

## 1.1 Common Emergencies Clinical Features

1.1.1 Anaphylactic Shock ICD10 CODE: T78.2 Severe allergic reaction that occurs rapidly (seconds or minutes) after administration, or exposure, and may be life threatening. It generally affects the whole body.

Causes
~ Allergy to pollens, some medicines (e.g., penicillins, vaccines, acetylsalicylic acid), or certain foods (e.g. eggs, fish, cow's milk, nuts, some food additives)
~ Reaction to insect bites, e.g., wasps and bees
~ Body itching, hives (urticarial rash), swelling of lips, eyes, tongue
~ Difficulty in breathing (stridor, wheezing)
~ Hypotension and sudden collapse, excessive sweating, thin pulse
~ Abdominal cramps, vomiting and diarrhoea.

Differential diagnosis
~ Other causes of shock, e.g., haemorrhagic (due to bleeding), hypovolemic (severe dehydration), septic
~ Asthma, foreign body in airways.

Notes Adrenaline: IM is the route of choice: absorption is rapid and more reliable than SC
 Monitor the patient for several hours (reaction may recur after several hours)
 If drug reaction, compile adverse drug reaction reporting form 
(see appendix 2)

~ Always ask about allergies before giving patients new medicine
~ Keep emergency drugs at hand at health facilities and in situatiuons where risk of anaphlaxis is high, e.g. visiting bee hives or places that usually harbour snakes
~ Counsel allergic patients to wear alert bracelet or tag.

## 1.1.2 Hypovolaemic Shock Icd10 Code: R57.1

Condition caused by severe acute loss of intravascular fluids leading to inadequate circulating volume and inadequate perfusion.

Causes
~ Loss of blood due to internal or external haemorrhage (e.g., 
post partum haemorrhage, splenic rupture etc.)
~ Acute loss of fluids, e.g. in gastroenteritis, or extensive burns Clinical features
~ High heart rate, fast breathing rate ~ Thin or absent pulse, cold extremities, slow capillary refill
~ Low blood pressure
~ Mental agitation, confusion

CHAPTER 1: Emergencies and Trauma A condition brought about by the loss of significant quantities of fluids and salts from the body.

Causes
~ Vomiting and/or diarrhoea
~ Decreased fluid intake
~ Excessive loss of fluids, e.g. due to polyuria in diabetes, excessive sweating as in high fever, burns Clinical features
~ Apathy, sunken eyes/fontanel, loss of skin turgor (especially in children)
~ Hypotension, tachycardia, deep (acidotic) breathing, dry mucosae, poor or no urine output.

 After 4 hours, evaluate rehydration in terms of clinical signs (NOT 
in terms of volumes of fluid given)
 As soon as signs of dehydration have disappeared (but not before), 
start fluid maintenance therapy, alternating ORS and water (to avoid hypernatraemia) as much as the patient wants Continue for as long as the cause of the original dehydration persists.

be increased or initial high rate of administration maintained until clinical improvement occurs

![14_image_2.png](14_image_2.png)

not available, use half-strength Darrow's solution in glucose 2.5% or sodium chloride infusion 0.9%. However, both of these are less effective Continued nutrition is important, and food should be continued during treatment for dehydration.

Caution

 Avoid artificially sweetened juices.

Prevention (for all age groups)
~ Encourage prompt use of ORS at home if the personis vomiting and/or having diarrhoea.

## 1.1.4 Fluids And Electrolytes Imbalances Icd10 Code: E87.8

A condition where losses of bodily fluids from whatever cause has led to significant disturbance in the normal fluid and electrolyte levels needed to maintain physiological functions.

Causes Disorders may occur in the fluid volume, concentration (sodium composition), and distribution of fluid and other electrolytes and ph. The main cause is problems in intake, loss and/or distribution and balance between water and electrolytes, as shown in the table below:

| MECHANISM                                              | EXAMPLES ~ Excessive vomiting and diarrhoea   |                         |

| Haemorrhage                                            | ~                                             | Internal or external    |
| Fluid sequestration                                    | ~                                             | Paralytic ileus, intestinal obstruction                         |

Clinical features
~ Dehydration in mild/moderate fluid (water and electrolytes) 
deficiency
~ Hypovolaemic shock in severe fluid deficiency
~ Oedema (including pulmonary oedema) in fluid excess
~ Specific effects due to electrolytes imbalances

IV fluids and electrolytes therapy has three main objectives:
~ Replace lost body fluids and continuing losses
~ Correct eventual imbalances
~ Maintain daily fluid requirements.

Always use an IV drip for patients who are seriously ill (except patients with congestive heart failure; for these, use only an indwelling needle) and may need IV drugs or surgery. If the fluid is not needed urgently, run it slowly to keep the IV line open.

## Maintenance Fluid Therapy

| TREATMENT   | LOC HC3   |
|-------------|-----------|
| Administer daily fluid and electrolyte requirements to any  patient not able to feed ‰ The basic 24-hour maintenance requirement for an  adult is 2.5-3 litres - One third of these daily fluids should be (isotonic) - sodium chloride 0.9% infusion (or Ringer's  Lactate), the other two thirds Glucose 5% infusion ‰ As well as the daily requirements, replace fluid lost due  to the particular condition according to the assessed  degree of dehydration. Notes ƒ Closely monitor all IV drips to ensure that the rate is adjusted as  required ƒ Check the drip site daily for any signs of infection; change  drip site every 2-3 days or when the drip goes into tissues  (extravasation).             |           |

 Or half-strength Darrow's solution in 2.5% glucose infusion Haemorrhage If there is blood loss and the patient is not in shock Use sodium chloride 0.9% infusion for blood volume replacement giving 0.5-1 L in the 1st hour and not more than 2-3 L in 4 hours If there is blood loss >1 litre Give 1-2 units of blood to replace volume and concentration Shock Give Ringer's Lactate or sodium chloride 0.9% infusion 20 ml/
kg IV over 60 minutes for initial volume resuscitation
- Start rapidly, closely monitor BP - Reduce the rate according to BP response In patients with severe shock and significant haemorrhage, give a blood transfusion Notes Closely monitor all IV drips to ensure that the rate is adjusted as required Check the drip site daily for any signs of infection; change drip site every 2-3 days or when the drip goes into tissues (extravasation).

## 1.1.5 Febrile Convulsions Icd10 Code: R56

A generalized tonic-clonic seizure associated with a rapid rise in temperature due to an extracranial illness. It is a diagnosis of exclusion: specific conditions (cerebral malaria, meningitis, epilepsy) should be excluded. It commonly affects children from age 3 months to 6 years.

Causes
~ Malaria
~ Respiratory tract infections
~ Urinary tract infections

## ~ Other Febrile Conditions Clinical Features

~ Elevated temperature (>38°C)
~ Convulsions usually brief and self-limiting (usually <5 minutes, always <15 minutes) but may recur if temperature remains high
~ No neurological abnormality in the period between convulsions
~ Generally benign and with good prognosis

## Differential Diagnosis

~ Epilepsy, brain lesions, meningitis, encephalitis
~ Trauma (head injury)
~ Hypoglycaemia
~ If intracranial pathology cannot be clinically excluded (especially in children <2 years) consider lumbar puncture or treat children empirically for meningitis

## Investigations

 Blood: Slide/RDT for malaria parasites Random blood glucose Full blood count LP and CSF examination
¾ Urinalysis, culture and sensitivity
¾ Chest X-ray Management

Educate caregivers on how to control fever (tepid sponging and paracetamol)

## 1.1.6 Hypoglycaemia Icd10 Code: E16.2

A clinical condition due to reduced levels of blood sugar (glucose). Symptoms generally occur with a blood glucose <3.0 mmol/L (55 mg/dl).

Cause
~ Overdose of insulin or anti-diabetic medicines
~ Excessive alcohol intakeSepsis, critical illnesses ~ Hepatic disease
~ Prematurity
~ Starvation ~ Operations to reduce the size of the stomach (gastrectomy)
~ Tumours of the pancreas (insulinomas)
~ Certain drugs e.g. quinine ~ Hormone deficiencies (cortisol, growth hormone)

~ Early symptoms: hunger, dizziness, tremors, sweating, nervousness and confusion 24 CHAPTER 1: Emergencies and Trauma
 
~ Profuse sweating, palpitations, weakness
~ Convulsions
~ Loss of consciousness Differential diagnosis
~ Other causes of loss of consciousness (poisoning, head injury etc.)
Investigations Blood sugar (generally <3.0 mmol/L)
 Specific investigations: to exclude other causes of hypoglycaemia Management

## Note

 After dextrose 50%, flush the IV line to avoid sclerosis of the vein 
(dextrose is very irritant)
 Preparation of Dextrose 10% from Dextrose 5% and Dextrose 50%:
- Remove 50 ml from Dextrose 5% bottle and discard
- Replace with 50 ml of Dextrose 50%. Shake
- Follow normal aseptic techniques
- Use immediately, DO NOT STORE.

~ Educate patients at risk of hypoglycaemia on recognition of early symptoms e.g. diabetics, patients who have had a gastrectomy
~ Advise patients at risk to have regular meals and to always have glucose or sugar with them for emergency treatment of hypoglycaemia
~ Advise diabetic patients to carry an identification tag

CHAPTER 1: Emergencies and Trauma Caution

TREATMENT LOC

 Do not suture bite wounds

## 1.2.1.1 Snakebites

Snakebites can cause both local and systemic effects. Non-venomous snakes cause local effects (swelling, redness, laceration) and venomous snakes cause both local and systemic effects due to envenomation. Over 70% of snakes in Uganda are non-venomous and most bites are from non-venomous snakes. Of the venomous snakes, more than 50% of bites are "dry" i.e. no envenomation occurs. In the event that venom is injected, the effect of the venom depends on the type of venom, quantity, location of the bite and size and general condition of the victim.

Cause
~ Common venomous snakes in Uganda: Puff adder, Gaboon viper, black mambas, Brown Forest cobra, Egyptian cobra and Boomslang (see below images of some of the common snakes in Uganda)

If cytotoxic venom (Puff adder, Gaboon viper)
~ Extensive local swelling, pain, lymphadenopathy - starting 10-30 minutes after the bite.

28 If neurotoxic venom (Jameson's mamba, Egyptian Cobra, Forest Cobra, Black mamba)
~ Weakness, paralysis, difficulty in breathing, drooping eyelids, difficulty in swallowing, double vision, slurred speech 
- starting 15-30 minutes after the bite
~ Excessive sweating and salivation If hemotoxic venom (Boomslang, Vine/Twig snake)
~ Excessive swelling and oozing from the site
~ Skin discoloration
~ Excessive bleeding, bloody blisters ~ Haematuria, haematemesis - even after some days
~ Shock If combined venom toxicity 
~ Late appearance of signs and symptoms Investigations
~ Whole blood clotting test at arrival and every 4-6 hours after the first day: 
 Put 2-5 ml of blood in a dry tube and observe after 30 minutes If incomplete or no clotting, it indicates coagulation abnormalities
~ Other useful tests depending on severity, level of care and availability:

## Dealing With The Patient

~ The combination of local wound treatment plus passive immunisation with rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) plus vaccination with rabies vaccine (RV) is recommended for all suspected exposures to rabies
~ if the RI is not available, the patient should still be vaccinated with the Rabies Vaccine alone
~ Since prolonged rabies incubation periods are possible, persons who present for evaluation and treatment even months after having been bitten should be treated in the same way as if the contact occurred recently
~ Administration of Rabies IG and vaccine depends on the type of exposure and the animal's condition

~ Vaccinate all domestic animals against rabies e.g. dogs, cats and others Administration of Rabies Vaccine (RV)
The following schedules use Purified VERO Cell Culture Rabies Vaccine (PVRV), which contains one intramuscular immunising dose (at least 2.5 IU) in 0.5 ml of reconstituted vaccine.

RV and RIG are both very expensive and should only be used when there is an absolute indication Post-Exposure Vaccination in Non-Previously Vaccinated Patients Give RV to all patients unvaccinated against rabies together with local wound treatment. In severe cases, also give rabies immunoglobulin The 2-1-1 intramuscular regimen This induces an early antibody response and may be particularly effective when post-exposure treatment does not include administration of rabies immunoglobulins Day 0: One dose (0.5 ml) in right arm + one dose in left arm Day 7: One dose Day 21: One dose Notes on IM doses Doses are given into the deltoid muscle of the arm. In young children, the anterolateral thigh may also be used Never use the gluteal area (buttock) as fat deposits may interfere 

![38_image_1.png](38_image_1.png)

Alternative: 2-site intradermal (ID) regimen This uses PVRV intradermal (ID) doses of 0.1 ml (i.e. one fifth of the 0.5 ml IM dose of PVRV) 
 Day 0: one dose of 0.1 ml in each arm (deltoid) 
 Day 3: one dose of 0.1 ml in each arm

![38_image_0.png](38_image_0.png)

 Day 3: one dose of 0.1 ml in each arm Day 7: one dose of 0.1 ml in each arm Day 28: one dose of 0.1 ml in each arm Notes on ID regime

![39_image_0.png](39_image_0.png)

 Much cheaper as it requires less vaccine Requires special staff training in ID technique using 1 ml syringes 

![39_image_1.png](39_image_1.png)

 Compliance with the Day 28 is vital but may be difficult to 

![39_image_2.png](39_image_2.png)

achieve Patients must be followed up for at least 6-18 months to confirm the outcome of treatment If on malaria chemoprophylaxis, do NOT use.

Post-exposure immunisation in previously vaccinated patients

![39_image_3.png](39_image_3.png)

In persons known to have previously received full pre- or post-exposure rabies vaccination within the last 3 years Intramuscular regimen Day 0: One booster dose IM 
 Day 3: One booster dose IM
Intradermal regimen Day 0: One booster dose ID
 Day 3: One booster dose ID
Note If incompletely vaccinated or immunosuppressed: give full post exposure regimen.

Passive immunisation with rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) Give in all high-risk rabies cases irrespective of the time between exposure and start of treatment BUT within 7 days of first vaccine.DO NOT USE in patient previously immunised.

CHAPTER 1: Emergencies and Trauma HRIG 20 IU/kg (do not exceed)
- Infiltrate as much as possible of this dose around the wound/s 
(if multiple wounds and insufficient quantity, dilute it 2 to 3 fold with normal saline)
- Give the remainder IM into gluteal muscle - Follow this with a complete course of rabies vaccine - The first dose of vaccine should be given at the same time as the immunoglobulin, but at a site as far away as possible from the site where the vaccine was injected. If the bite is at or near the upper arm, do not infiltrate the wound with the immunoglobulin unless the vaccine won't be injected in the deltoid muscle of that arm. If the wound near the deltoid is infiltrated with the immunoglobulin, use the deltoid muscle of the opposite arm for the vaccine".

## Notes

 If RIG not available at first visit, its administration can be delayed up to 7 days after the first dose of vaccine.

## Pre-Exposure Immunisation

Offer rabies vaccine to persons at high risk of exposure such as:
 Laboratory staff working with rabies virus Veterinarians Animal handlers Zoologists/wildlife officers Any other persons considered to be at high risk Day 0: One dose IM or ID Day 7: One dose IM or ID Day 28: One dose IM or ID

1.2.3 Burns ICD10 CODE: T20-T25 Tissue injury caused by thermal, chemical, electrical, or radiation energy.

Causes
~ Thermal, e.g., hot fluids, flame, steam, hot solids, sun
~ Chemical, e.g., acids, alkalis, and other caustic chemicals
~ Electrical, e.g., domestic (low voltage) transmission lines 
(high voltage), lightening
~ Radiation, e.g., exposure to excess radiotherapy or radioactive materials

~ Pain, swelling
~ Skin changes (hyperaemia, blisters, singed hairs) ~ Skin loss (eschar formation, charring)
~ Reduced ability to use the affected part
~ Systemic effects in severe/extensive burns include shock, low urine output, generalised swelling, respiratory insufficiency, deteriorated mental state
~ Breathing difficulty, hoarse voice and cough in smoke inhalation injury - medical emergency Criteria for classification of the severity of burns

In superficial 2nd degree burns, blisters result, the  pink moist wound is painful. A thin eschar is  formed. Heals in 10-14 days. In deep 2nd degree burns, blisters are lacking,  the wound is pale, moderately painful, a thick  escar is formed. Heals in >1 month, requiring surgical debridement 3rd Degree burns Full thickness skin destruction, leather- like  rigid eschar. Painless on palpation or pinprick.  Requires skin graft. 4th Degree burns Full thickness skin and fascia, muscles, or bone  destruction.

Fluid replacement in burns
~ The objective is to maintain normal physiology as shown by urine output, vital signs and mental status
~ Fluid is lost from the circulation into the tissues surrounding the burns and some is lost through the wounds, especially in 18-30 hours after the burns
~ Low intravascular volume results in tissue circulatory insufficiency (shock) with results such as kidney failure and deepening of the burns

| TREATMENT   |                                                                                                                                                   | LOC HC2  HC3   |

~ The fluid requirements are often very high and so should be given as necessary to ensure adequate urine output CHAPTER 1: Emergencies and Trauma

~ Public awareness of burn risks and first aid water use in cooling burnt skin
~ Construction of raised cooking fire places as safety measure
~ Ensure safe handling of hot water and food, keep well out of the reach of children
~ Particular care of high risk persons near fires e.g. children, epileptic patients, alcohol or drug abusers
~ Encourage people to use closed flames e.g. hurricane lamps. Avoid candles.

~ Beware of possible cases of child abuse

## 1.2.4 Wounds Icd10 Code: S00-T88

CHAPTER 1: Emergencies and Trauma

# 1.2.5 Head Injuries Icd10 Code: S00-S09

Trauma to the head resulting in brain injuries due to:
- Direct damage to the brain (contusion, concussion, penetrating injury, diffuse axonal damage)
- Haemorrhage from rupture of blood vessels around and in - the brain - Severe swelling of the cerebral tissue (cerebral oedema)
Causes
~ Road traffic accident
~ Assault, fall or a blow to the head Clinical features
~ May be closed (without a cut) or open (with a cut)
~ Swelling on the head (scalp hematoma)
~ Fracture of the skull, e.g., depressed area of the skull, open fracture (brain matter may be exposed)
~ Racoon eyes (haematoma around the eyes), bleeding and/ 
or leaking of CSF through nose, ears - signs of possible skull base fracture Severe head injury
~ Altered level of consciousness, agitation, coma (see GCS 
below)
~ Seizures, focal neurological deficits, pupil abnormalities Minor head injury (concussion)
~ Transient and short lived loss of mental function, e.g., loss of consciousness (<5 minutes), transient amnesia, headache, disorientation, dizziness, drowsiness, vomiting
- symptoms should improve by 4 hours after the trauma

Mild injuries can still be associated with significant brain damage and can be divided into low and high risk according to the following criteria:
Investigations
¾ Skull X ray useful only to detect fracture ¾ CT scan is the gold standard for detection of head injury Differential diagnosis
~ Alcoholic coma - may occur together with a head injury ~ Hypoglycaemia
~ Meningitis
~ Poisoning ~ Other cause of coma Management (general principles)
Management depends on:
~ GCS and clinical features at first assessment
~ Risk factors (mechanism of trauma, age, baseline conditions)
~ GCS and clinical features at follow up

Management of severe traumatic head injury Prevention
~ Careful (defensive) driving to avoid accidents
~ Use of safety belts by motorists ~ Wearing of helmets by cyclists, motor-cyclists and people working in hazardous environments
~ Avoid dangerous activities (e.g., climbing trees)

## 1.2.5.1 Traumatic Spinal Injury

Early recognition of spinal injury. Immobilizations with a rigid cervical collar or thoracolumbar corset to prevent further nerve damage. Decompression: Non operative Skull traction, Skin traction of lower limbs Operative e.g., discectomy, anterior or posterior spinal decompression surgery 59 CHAPTER 1: Emergencies and Trauma

## 1.2.6 Sexual Assault/Rape Icd10 Code Z04.4

Rape is typically defined as oral, anal or vaginal penetration that involves threats or force against an unwilling person. Such penetration, whether wanted or not, is considered statutory rape if victims are younger than the age of consent (18 years). Sexual assault or any other sexual contact that results from coercion is rape, including seduction of a child through offers of affection or bribes; it also includes being touched, grabbed, kissed or shown genitals.

Clinical features Rape may result in the following:

~ Extragenital injury
~ Genital injury (usually minor, but some vaginal lacerations can be severe)
~ Psychologic symptoms: often the most prominent
- Short term: fear, nightmares, sleep problems, anger, embarrassment
- Long term: Post traumatic Stress Disorder, an anxiety - disorder; symptoms include re-experiencing (e.g., flashbacks, intrusive upsetting thoughts or images), avoidance (e.g., of trauma-related situations, thoughts, and feelings) and hyperarousal (e.g., sleep difficulties, irritability, concentration problems).

- Symptoms last for >1 month and significantly impair social and occupational functioning.

- Shame, guilt or a combination of both
- Sexually transmitted infections (STIs, e.g., hepatitis, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, trichomoniasis, HIV infection)
~ Pregnancy (may occur)
Note Headaches and dizziness following mild traumatic brain injury may persist for weeks/months Management of moderate traumatic head injury

Investigations Pregnancy test HIV, hepatitis B and RPR tests

Whenever possible, assessment of a rape case should be done by a specially trained provider. Victims are traumatized so should be approached with empathy and respect. Explain and ask consent for every step undertaken.

The goals are:
~ Medical assessment and treatment of injuries
~ Assessment, treatment and prevention of pregnancy and STIs Collection of forensic evidence
~ Psychologic evaluation and support

## 1.3 Poisoning 1.3.1 General Management Of Poisoning Icd10 Code: T36-T50

Bodily entry of toxic substances in amounts that cause dysfunction of body systems.

Causes
~ Microorganisms (food poisoning)
~ Fluids and gases (organic), e.g., agricultural chemicals, petrol, paraffin, carbon monoxide
~ Metal poisoning (inorganic), e.g., lead, mercury, copper ~ Alcohol, drugs of abuse, medicines (in excessive amounts)
Acute poisoning can occur by ingestion, inhalation, injection or cutaneous/mucosal absorption.

Exposure can be intentional (e.g., suicide or homicide attempt), unintentional (e.g., medication error) or environmental/ occupational.

Principles of general management If possible, refer patients showing signs of poisoning to hospital for admission. Send a note of what is known about the poison and what treatment has been given Also refer/admit patients who have taken slow-acting poisons even if they appear well. These include: acetylsalicylic acid, iron, paracetamol, tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline, imipramine), 
paraquat, modified-release products Optimal management of the poisoned patient depends upon the specific poison(s) involved, the presenting and predicted severity of illness and time that has elapsed between exposure and presentation Treatment includes supportive care, decontamination, antidotal therapy and enhanced elimination techniques It may not always be possible to identify the poison and the amount taken. Anyway, Only a few poisons have specific antidotes Few patients need active removal of the poison Most patients must be treated symptomatically However, knowledge of the poison will help you anticipate the likely effects on the patient.

## 1.3.1.2 Removal And Elimination Of Ingested Poison

Removal and elimination of poison (decontamination) has to be implemented AFTER stabilization of vital signs.

## Removal From The Stomach

~ Balance the dangers of attempting to empty the stomach against the likely toxicity of any swallowed poison as determined by the type of poison and amount swallowed against the risk of inhalation
~ Do not induce vomiting
~ Gastric lavage Only useful if done within 2 hours of poisoning (except with salicylates or anticholinergics when it may be of use within 4 to 6 hours)
 Seldom practicable or necessary before the patient reaches hospital Contraindications: drowsy or comatose patients and if poisoning with corrosive or petroleum products Prevention of absorption and active elimination
~ Oral activated charcoal can bind many poisons in the stomach and reduce their absorption
~ It is more effective the sooner it is given but may still work up to 2 hours after poisoning (longer with modified-release products and anticholinergics)
~ Contraindications
- Depressed mental status - Late presentation - Ingestion of corrosives and petroleum products - Toxins poorly absorbed by charcoal (e.g. metals like iron, lithium, alcohol)
- Intestinal obstruction
~ It is generally safe and especially useful for poisons toxic insmall amounts, e.g. antidepressants

## 1.3.5 Paracetamol Poisoning Icd10 Code: T39.1

Accidental or intentional assumption of excessive amount of paracetamol. Toxic dose: >150 mg/kg or >7.5 g (200 mg/kg for children <6 years)

~ First 24 hours: asymptomatic or aspecific symptoms such as nausea and vomiting, malaise, anorexia, abdominal pain
~ In patients with mild poisoning, symptoms will resolve and patient will recover. In patients with severe poisoning, symptoms will progress to the next phase
~ In 24-72 hours: progressive signs of hepatic toxicity (e.g. 

right upper quadrant abdominal pain, enlarged tender liver, increased transaminases)
~ After 72 hours: signs and symptoms peak at 72-96 hours and this may be followed by full recovery in 5-7 days or progression into irreversible hepatic failure (less frequently renal failure) 
and death Investigations Monitor liver function, renal funtion, INR Rule out pregnancy (it crosses the placental barrier)

## 1.4 Hypoxeamia Management And Oxygen Therapy Guidelines

Hypoxaemia is the low concentration of Oxygen in blood or oxygen saturation (SpO2) less than 90% in peripheral arterial blood detected on pulse oximeter reading. Hypoxaemia is a life-threatening condition correlated with disease severity and an emergency stat. Left untreated and for prolonged periods of time, it results into low tissue oxygen concentration (Hypoxia), and this leads to death. 

 Causes 
~ Surgical causes.

- Head Injury, Chest trauma
~ Medical Causes
- Severe Asthma, Pneumonia, Sepsis, Shock, Malaria, Covid-19, Heart Failure, Cardiac arrest, Upper airway obstruction, Severe anaemia, Pertussis, Carbon Monoxide poisoning.

~ Obstetric, gynaecological, and perioperative causes.

- Obstructed labour, Ruptured uterus, Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, Post caesarean section, 
~ Neonatal causes
- Transient tachypnoea of the new-born, Hypoxic Ischaemic encephalopathy (Birth asphyxia), Respiratory distress Syndrome, Neonatal Septicaemia.

## Diagnosis

 Do a clinical assessment (history taking for symptoms and physical examination for signs)
 Pulse oximetry and blood gas analysis. The findings on clinical assessment (symptoms and signs) [It is non-invasive but associated with missed opportunities for diagnosis].

## Symptoms

 Fast/very slow breathing, Difficulty in breathing, Inability to talk, complete sentences Extreme weakness Inability to feed Confusion, sleepy, agitated Convulsions

Fast breathing rate for age (Tachypnoea)

| Rate     | Age           | Implication   |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| > 60 bpm | 0 - 2months   | Tachypnoea    |
| > 50 bpm | 2-12 months   | Tachypnoea    |
| > 40bpm  | 12- 59 months | Tachypnoea    |
| > 40bpm  | 5-12years     | Tachypnoea    |
| > 20bpm  | Adults        | Tachypnoea    |

 Nasal flaring Head nodding Chest in drawing (Intercostal, subcostal recession) Cyanosis (peripheral or central)
 Prostration Glasgow coma scale< 10/15 Use of any accessory muscles of respiration 
 
Management
~ Pulse oximetry use. Always refer to the manufacturer's insert or the steps outlined below for guidance on how to use the pulse oximetera.

~ The steps involved in conducting pulse-oximetry Turn on the Pulse oximeter.

 Attach the Oximeter probe to the finger or toe.

 Wait until there is a consistent pulse -wave signal before you take the reading, this may take 20-30 seconds.

 Record the reading and act accordingly.

~ Interpreting pulse-oximetry results SpO2 > 90% without danger signs = Normal SpO2 < 90% =Low oxygen concentration in blood (Hypoxaemia)
 SpO2 <92- 95% in Pregnancy = Low oxygen concentration in blood (Hypoxaemia)
 SpO2 < 94 % with danger signs = Low oxygen concentration in blood (Hypoxaemia Blood gas analysis-direct measurement of the partial pressure of oxygen 
(Pao2) and Carbon dioxide (PC02) 2, the PH and electrolytes concentration in blood. It is the most accurate, but it is highly skill dependant, expensive and invasive.

Treatment

## Oxygen Therapy

The treatment of hypoxaemia includes the use of Medical Oxygen (Oxygen therapy) and specifically treating the underlying cause. 

Indications 
~ All patients with documented Hypoxaemia-arterial Oxygen tension (Paco2) of < 60 mmHg or peripheral arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) OF < 90%.

## Chapter 1: Emergencies And Trauma

~ Patients with the following danger/emergency signs irrespective of the documented SpO2, PaCO2. 

~ Absent or obstructed breathing, Features of severe respiratory distress, Central cyanosis, Convulsions, Signs of shock, Coma
~ All acute conditions in which Coma is suspected like:
~ Acute Asthma, Severe Trauma, Acute myocardial Infarction, Carbon monoxide poisoning
~ Post anaesthesia recovery.

~ Increased metabolic demand
~ Severe burns, Poisoning, Multiple injuries, Severe infections Medical Oxygen dosing and appropriate use of delivery device. 

~ The dosing of oxygen is dependent on the age of the patient and severity of disease while the choice of appropriate delivery devices depends on the amount or dose of oxygen to be delivered to a patient.

Titrate oxygen based on oxygen saturation and delivery device.

NB: Mild –Moderate illness start with 5l/min by nasal cannula For older children and adults with severe disease, give 10-15l/min via face mask with a reservoir bag.

 Older children and severe disease with mild –moderate disease give 6-10l/min via a simple face mask Children below 5years of age that require >5l/min of oxygen, the preferred delivery device is CPAP.

~ Titration and weaning patients off Oxygen How to Escalate or increase oxygen in non-Responsive Adult patients with consistent Spo2 below 90%.

| Worsening respiratory distress with   |
|---------------------------------------|
| SpO2<90%                              |

Start oxygen therapy at a rate of 1-5litres/min Use Nasal prongs Assess response Use a simple face mask, give 5-10litres/minute Assess response Worsening respiratory distress with SpO2<90%
Use a mask with a reservoir bag, ensure the bag is well inflated. Give 10-15litres/minute. Assess for response.

Worsening respiratory distress with SpO2<90%
Continue to try to find a higher level of care and consider one of the following if available and adequate O2 supply: HFNO: 30-60 LPM (may also adjust FiO2)| CPAP: 10-15 cmH20 BIPAP: PS (ΔP) 5-15/PEEP (EPAP) 5-15
~ Weaning patient off oxygen The oxygen flowrate/ dose should be decreased if patient stabilizes or improves with SpO2 above 90%.

 Decrease oxygen flow by 1-2Litre/min once patient is stable with Oxygen saturation above 92%. 

 Observe the patient for 2-3 minutes, reassess after 15 mins to ensure Sp02 is still above 90% (by recording clinical exam and SpO2)
 If a patient does not tolerate less oxygen, then maintain the flow rate that the patient has been on prior to reducing until the patient is stable (Sp02 >92%)
 If a patient is in increased respiratory distress or Sp02 less than 90%, then increased the oxygen flow rate to the previous rate until the patient is stable.

 If a patient remains stable after 15 mins of reassessment and Sp02 
>92%, continue to titrate oxygen down as tolerated.

Recheck clinical status and Sp02 on the patient after 1 hour for delayed hypoxemia or respiratory distress.

Change humidifier water weekly with distilled or rain water, and daily, with tap water Regiace particle filter each wask with a claan, dry ane [wash in detergent, risue thoroughly and allow to dry Oxypen can spread fire very rapidty.

Never allew an open flame or a cigarette within Jmeter of an exygen source Once child is stable (Sp@: > 70%)
Disconnect O: for 10-15min SpOs > 90% = monitor for rest of day before discharge SpOr < 90% = restart Or

## Oxygen Cylinders

SET UP
Fit the connecting nut attached to the head into the cylinder and fasten it with use of spanner by turning it clockwise Tiphten all connections so orygen does not leak Connect oxygen tubing to the orygen outlet of the humidifier
-
Carefully open the regulator and check the amount of oxypen in the cylinder on the gauge If the gauge is in the red zone
.

then the hattle will need changing soon and might not last through a night shift
-
Change humidifier water weekly with distilled or rain water, and daily, with tap water.

## 2.1 Bacterial Infections 2.1.1 Anthrax Icd10 Code: A22.10-A22.9

Anthrax is an acute zoonotic infectious disease caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis. It most commonly occurs in wild and domestic animals, such as cattle, sheep, goats, camels, antelopes, and other herbivores. B. anthracis spores can live in the soil for many years.

It occurs in humans when they are exposed to infected animals or tissue from infected animals. The incubation period is usually 1-3 days. 

Anthrax is a notifiable disease.

Cause
~ Exposure to B. anthracis spores by handling products from infected animals or by inhaling anthrax spores from contaminated animal products
~ Anthrax can also be spread by eating undercooked meat from infected animals

Symptoms vary depending on how the disease was contracted, and usually occur within 7 days

## Investigations

¾ Isolation of Bacillus anthracis from blood, skin lesions, or respiratory secretions- Smear-many bacilli
¾ Or measure specific antibodies in the blood of persons with suspected infection

| ‰                   | Or amoxicillin 1 g every 8 hours                  |

The following public measures are key for quick prevention and control of anthrax infection:
~ Health education and information
~ Proper disposal by burying of carcasses, hides and skins; 
(no burning as it can spread spores)
~ No skinning of dead animals; this allows spore formation, which can stay in soil for decades
~ No eating of meat from dead animals
~ Restrict movement of animals and animal by-products from infected to non-infected areas
~ Mass vaccination of animals in endemic areas ~ Vaccination using human anthrax vaccine for:
- Persons who work directly with the organism in the laboratory - Persons who handle potentially infected animal products - in high-incidence areas

## 2.1.2 Brucellosis Icd11Code: A23.9

(Undulant fever, malta fever, abortus fever)
A zoonotic bacterial infection of acute onset. Common as an occupational CHAPTER 2: Infectious Diseases
 
disease among people working with infected livestock or associated fresh animal products, for example butchers, farmers, abattoir workers, and vendors of contaminated roasted meat (muchomo). Incubation is 2-4 weeks on average, but it can be from 1 to 8 weeks.

Causes
~ Brucella abortus (cattle)
~ Brucella canis (dog)
~ Brucella melitensis (goats and sheep)
~ Brucella suis (pigs)
Clinical features
~ Intermittent (fluctuating) fever
~ Aches and pains
~ Orchitis (inflammation of the testes)
~ Vertebrae osteomyelitis (uncommon but characteristic)
Differential diagnosis
~ Typhoid fever, malaria, tuberculosis
~ Trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness)
~ Other causes of prolonged fever Investigations
¾ Blood: complement fixation test or agglutination test (where possible)
The interpretation of serological tests can be difficult, particularly in endemic areas where a high proportion of the population has antibodies against brucellosis. Positive serological test results can persist long after recovery in treated individuals so results have to be interpreted on the basis of the clinical picture.

Isolation of the infectious agent from blood, bone marrow, or other tissues by culture Management

Prevention
~ Provide public health education on
- Drinking only pasteurised or boiled milk - Careful handling of pigs, goats, dogs, and cattle if a person has wounds or cuts
- Provide veterinary services for domestic animals

# 2.1.3 Diphtheria Icd10 Code: A36.9

An acute bacterial infection caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, which is spread through droplet infection and mainly occurs in the nasopharynx. The bacteria produce a toxin which is responsible for the systemic effects. Incubation period is 2-7 days.

## Cause

~ Toxin of Corynebacterium diphtheriae Clinical features
~ Pseudomembranous tonsillitis (grey, tough and very stickly membranes) with dysphagia, cervical adenitis, at times progressing to massive swelling of the neck
~ Airway obstruction and possible suffocation when infection extends to the nasal passages, larynx, trachea and bronchi
~ Low grade fever
~ Effects of the toxin: cardiac dysfunction (myocarditis with heart failure), neuropathies 1-3 months after the onset affecting swallowing, vision, breathing and ambulation
~ Renal failure Investigation

## 2.1.4 Leprosy/Hansens Disease Icd10 Code: A30.0

A chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae/Hansens bacillus - an acid-fast bacillus. It mainly affects the skin, peripheral nerves and mucous membranes. It is transmitted from one person to another via the respiratory tract (possibly, very rarely, through broken skin). It is classified into paucibacillary (PB) or Multibacillary (MB) Leprosy.

Clinical features
~ Pale or reddish patches on the skin (The most common sign of leprosy)
~ Loss or decrease in feeling in the skin patch
~ Numbness or tingling of the hands or feet.

~ Weakness of the hands, feet or eyelids
~ Painful or tender nerves
~ Swelling or lamps in the face or earlobes
~ Painless wounds or burns on the hands or feet Case definition A case of leprosy is a person with clinical signs of leprosy who requires chemotherapy.

Diagnosis of leprosy Diagnosis of Leprosy must be based on careful clinical examination of the patient and when necessary, backed by bacteriological examination Leprosy is diagnosed by finding at least one of the three cardinal signs:
- Hypopigmented patches with definite loss of sensation in them
- Thickened or enlarged peripheral nerves, with loss of sensation and/or weakness of the muscles supplied by those nerves
- The presence of acid-fast bacilli in a slit skin smear Classification of leprosy Paucibacillary (PB) leprosy - 1-5 patches Multibacillary (MB) Leprosy - More than 5 patches CHAPTER 2: Infectious Diseases Differential diagnosis
~ Hypopigmentation e.g. birthmark, early vitiligo
~ Fungal infections of the skin
~ Molluscum contagiosum
~ Other nodular conditions, e.g. Kaposi's sarcoma, neurofibromatosis, secondary syphilis
~ Other causes of peripheral nerve damage, e.g. diabetes mellitus
~ Psoriasis, molluscum contagiosum Investigations
¾ In most cases, a definite diagnosis of leprosy can be made using clinical signs alone
¾ At referral centre: stain slit skin smears for Acid Fast Bacilli (AFB)
¾ Skin biopsies NOT recommended as a routine procedure

Multi-drug therapy (MDT) for leprosy is presented in the form of various monthly dose blister packs. The same three drugs are used for both PB leprosy and MB leprosy, with special packs for children Summary of Treatment of leprosy

## Disability Due To Leprosy

Leprosy commonly causes physical disabilities which generate social stigma. Disability refers to an impairment (primary or secondary) that makes it difficult or impossible for the affected person to carry out certain activities, e.g. affecting manual dexterity, personal care, mobility and communication behavior Definitions of disability:
In the hands and feet:
Grade 0 = No anesthesia, no visible deformity or damage Grade 1 = Anaesthesia, but no visible deformity or damage 105
 
Grade 2 = Visible deformity or damage present In the eyes Grade 0 = no eye problem due to leprosy, no evidence of visual loss Grade 1 = eye problem due to presence of leprosy, but vision not severy affected as a result (6/60 or better, can count fingers at six meters) Grade 2 = severe visual impairment (vision worse than 6/60; inability to count fingers at six meters), lagophthalmos, iridocyclitis, corneal opacities Management of Disability in the hand and feet Resting of the affected limb in the acute phase can be aided by splinting, especially at night
~ Soaking and oiling for about 30 minutes every day of dry skin helps to prevent cracking and preserves the integrity of the epidermis.

~ Use of a clean dry cloth to cover the wounds and walking as little as possible and walk slowly, taking frequent rest. 

Passive exercise and stretching to avoid contractures and strengthen muscle weakness
~ Use of a rough stone to smoothen the skin on the feet or palms,
~ Protective foot wear (MCR Sandals) al, the time. For insensitive feet and protective appliances like gloves for insensitive hands Eye complications due to Leprosy These include 1. **Lagophthalmos:** whole spectrum 2**.Corneal hypoesthesia:** with/without corneal ulcers 3. Acute iritis and scleriti 4.Chronic iritis and iris atrophy

## Treatment & Management Of Eye Complications

Medical therapy for eye complications due to Leprosy- use of the topical antibiotics and topical steroids. It is strongly recommended that an ophthalmologist and a trained leprologist, if available, be included in the treatment of Hansen disease with ocular manifestations.

## 2.1.5 Meningitis Icd10 Codes: A39.0 (Meningococcal), G00, G01, G02

Meningitis is acute inflammation of the meninges (the membranes covering the brain). Bacterial meningitis is a notifiable disease.

Causative organisms Most commonly bacterial: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b (mainly in young children), Neisseria meningitidis, Enteric bacilli
~ Viral (HSV, enteroviruses, HIV, VZV etc) ~ Cryptococcus neoformans (in the immune-suppressed)
~ Mycobacterium tuberculosis Clinical features
~ Rapid onset of fever
~ Severe headache and neck stiffness or pain
~ PhotophobiaHaemorrhagic rash (N.meningitidis infection) ~ Convulsions, altered mental state, confusion, coma
~ In mycobacterial and cryptococcal meningitis, the clinical presentation can be sub-acute , over a period of several days or 1-2 weeks Differential diagnosis
~ Brain abscess ~ Space-occupying lesions in the brain
~ Drug reactions or intoxications Investigations CSF: usually cloudy if bacterial, clear if viral. Analyse for white cell count and type, protein, sugar, Indian-ink staining (for Cryptococcus), gram stain, culture and sensitivity Blood: For serological studies and full blood count Blood: for culture and sensitivity Chest X-ray and ultrasound to look for possible primary site Management Because of the potential severity of the disease, refer all patients to hospital after pre-referral dose of antibiotic. Carry out lumbar puncture promptly and initiate empirical antibiotic regimen Treatment depends on whether the causative organisms are already identified or not.

## 2.1.8 Tetanus Icd10 Code: A35

Bacterial disease characterised by intermittent spasms (twitching) of voluntary muscles. Incubation period is from few days to few weeks (average7-10 days).

Cause
~ Exotoxin of Clostridium tetani ~ Common sources of infection: tetanus spores enter the body through deep penetrating skin wounds, the umbilical cord of the newborn, ear infection, or wounds produced during delivery and septic abortions

~ Stiff jaw, difficulty in opening mouth (trismus) ~ Generalised spasms induced by sounds and/or strong light, characterised by grimace (risus sardonicus)
~ Arching of back (opisthotonus) with the patient remaining clearly conscious
~ Fever
~ Glottal spasms and difficulty in breathing
~ Absence of a visible wound does not exclude tetanus Differential diagnosis
~ Meningoencephalitis, meningitis
~ Phenothiazine side-effects
~ Febrile convulsions

Prevention
~ Immunise all children against tetanus during routine childhood immunisation
~ Proper wound care and immunisation (see chapter 18):
- Full course if patient not immunised or not fully immunised - Booster if fully immunised but last dose >10 years ago - Fully immunised who had a booster <10 years ago do not need any specific treatment
~ Prophylaxis in patients at risk as a result of contaminated wounds: give Tetanus immunoglobulin human (TIG) IM 
Child < 5 years: 75 IU

## Child 5-10 Years: 125 Iu

Child > 10 years and adults: 250 IU Double the dose if heavy contamination or wound obtained > 24 hours.

## 2.1.8.1 Neonatal Tetanus Icd10 Code: A33

Neonatal tetanus is a notifiable disease
~ Caused by infection of the umbilicus through cutting of the cord with unsterile instruments or from putting cow dung or other unsuitable materials on the stump
~ Usually presents 3-14 days after birth with irritability and difficulty in feeding due to masseter ( jaw muscle) spasm, rigidity, generalised muscle spasms. The neonate behaves normally for the first few days before the symptoms appear.

# 2.2.1 Candidiasis Icd10 Code: B37

Fungal infection usually confined to the mucous membranes and external layers of skin. Severe forms are usually associated with immunosuppressive conditions, such as HIV/AIDS, diabetes, pregnancy, cancer, prolonged antibiotic use, and steroids.

Causes
~ Candida albicans, transmitted by direct contact

It may present as:
~ Oral thrush
~ Intertrigo (between skin folds)
~ Vulvo vaginitis and abnormal vaginal discharge (vaginal candida is not a sexually transmitted disease)
~ Chronic paronychia (inflammation involving the proximal and lateral fingernail folds)
~ Gastrointestinal candidiasis may present with pain on swallowing, vomiting, diarrhoea, epigastric and retrosternal pain

## Investigations

 Diagnosis is mainly clinical In case of vaginitis, sample collection –a high vaginal swab 
(protected by a speculum), pH, KOH , wet preparation and
~ Gram stain, C&S
 Smear examination with potassium hydroxide (KOH)

## 2.3 Viral Infections 2.3.1 Avian Influenza Icd10 Code: J09.X2

Influenza caused by avian (bird) influenza Type A viruses (mainly H5N1 strain). It is endemic in the poultry population in Eurasia and can occasionally be transmitted to humans through direct contact with sick birds (inhalation of infectious droplets). Disease can be mild or severe and has limited potential to spread from person to person but there is risk of mutations giving rise to a very infectious virus which could cause widespread epidemics. Avian flu is a notifiable disease.

Cause
~ Avian (bird) influenza Type A viruses Clinical features
~ Conjuctivitis 130 
 
~ Flu symptoms: fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches
~ Gastrointestinal (diarrhoea) and neurological symptoms
~ In some cases, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
Investigations Blood and respiratory specimens, nose swab: lab test for influenza and rule out bacterial infection
- Testing must be in a special laboratory Management

Discharge policy
~ Infection control precautions for adult patients should remain in place for 7 days after resolution of fever and for 21 days in children younger than 12 years
~ Children should not attend school during this period Control and Prevention of Nosocomial Spread of Influenza A (H5N1)
Health workers should observe the following to prevent the spread of avian influenza in the health care facilities:
~ Observe droplet and contact precautions. In addition, get negative pressure room if available
~ Isolate the patient to a single room
~ Place beds more than 1 metre apart and preferably separated by a physical barrier (e.g., curtain, partition)
~ Appropriate personal protective equipment (APPE) in all those entering patients' rooms. APPE includes high efficiency mask, gown, face shield or goggles, and gloves
~ Limit the number of health care workers (HCWs) and other hospital employees who have direct contact with the patient(s). These HCWs should:
~ Be properly trained in infection control precautions
~ Monitor their own temperature twice daily and report any febrile event to hospital authorities
~ A HCW who has a fever (>380C) and who has had direct patient contact should be treated immediately 132 CHAPTER 2: Infectious Diseases
~ Restrict the number of visitors, provide them with APPE, 
and instruct them in its use

## 2.3.2 Chicken Pox Icd10 Code: B01

A highly contagious viral infection. Patients are contagious from 2 days before onset of the rash until all lesions have crusted. An attack of chicken pox usually confers lifelong immunity. Disease is more severe and complicated in adults.

Causes
~ Varicella Zoster virus (VZV) by droplet infection

~ Incubation period is 14 days, but shorter in immuno- compromised host
~ Mild fevers occur 10-20 days after exposure
~ Prodromal symptoms consisting of low fever, headache, and malaise occurring 2 to 3 days before the eruption
~ Eruptive phase: they appear as macules, papules, vesicles, pustules and crusts. The most characteristic lesion is a vesicle looking like a drop of water on the skin. Vesicles rupture easily and may become infected
~ The rash begins on the trunk and spreads to the face and extremities
~ Lesions of different stages (crops) exist together at the same time in any given body area
~ Complications may include septicaemia, pneumonia, fulminating haemorrhagic varicella, and meningoencephalitis

## Differential Diagnosis

~ Drug-induced eruption
~ Scabies
~ Insect bites
~ Erythema multiforme, impetigo
~ Other viral infections with fever and skin rash 133 Investigations
¾ Virus isolation possible but not necessary ¾ Diagnosis is practically clinical Management

## 2.3.4 Poliomyelitis Icd10 Code: A80.3

An acute viral infection characterised by acute onset of flaccid paralysis of skeletal muscles. It is transmitted from person to person through the faecal-oral route. Poliomyelitis is a notifiable disease.

Cause
~ Polio virus (enterovirus) types I, II, and III

~ Majority of cases are asymptomatic, only 1% result in flaccid paralysis ~ Non-paralytic form: minor illness of fever, malaise, headache, and vomiting, muscle pains, spontaneous recovery in 10 days
~ Paralytic form: after the aspecific symptoms, rapid onset 
(from morning to evening) of asymmetric flaccid paralysis, 136 
 
predominantly of the lower limbs, with ascending progression
~ Paralysis of respiratory muscles is life threatening (bulbar polio)
~ Aseptic meningitis may occur as a complication Differential diagnosis
~ Guillain-Barré syndrome
~ Traumatic neuritis
~ Transverse myelitis
~ Pesticides and food poisoning Consider all cass of Acute Flaccid Paralysis as possible Poliomyelitis: alert the district focal person for epidemic control, and send 2 stool samples (refrigerated).

Investigations Isolation of the virus from stool samples Viral culture Ensure that Giardia intestinalis, Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora, sarcocystis, Toxoplasma gondii are included in the investigations Management

| TREATMENT   | LOC   |
|-------------|-------|

## 2.3.5 Rabies Icd10 Code: A82

Rabies is a viral infection of wild and domestic animals, transmitted to humans by saliva of infected animals through bites, scratches or licks on broken skin or mucuos membranes. Once symptoms develop, rabies presents as a fatal encephalitis: there is no cure and treatment is palliative.

Before symptomatic disease has developed, rabies can effectively be prevented by post-exposure prophylaxis.

Cause
~ Rabies virus. Incubation is average 20-90 days but can be 138 
 
CHAPTER 2: Infectious Diseases shorter in severe exposure (multiple bites, bites on face/ neck) of even longer (> a year) in a few cases

~ Itching or paraesthesiae (abnormal sensation) around site of exposure, malaise, fever
~ Neurologic phase
~ Furious form: psychomotor agitation or hydrophobia (throat spasm and panic, triggered by attempt to drink or sight/ sound/touch of water) and aerophobia (similar response to a draft of air)
~ Paralytic form (rarer): progressive ascending paralysis

# 2.3.6 Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers

## 2.3.6.1 Ebola And Marburg Icd11 Code: A99

Ebola and Marburg are severe zoonotic multisystem febrile diseases caused by RNA viruses. They are notifiable diseases.

## Cause

~ Ebola and Marburg viruses. Transmission to humans happens through contact with meat or body fluids of an infected animal. The disease can then be transmitted from human to human through body fluids (including semen for months after recovery) and it is highly contagious.

## Risk Factors

~ Communities around game parks
~ Communities in endemic area
~ Cultural practices like burial rituals ~ Poor infection control practices
~ History of exposure to infected people in the last 2 to 21 days i.e sexual partner, breastfeeding mothers
~ Recent contact with infected animals e.g. monkeys, bats, infected game meat
~ Clinical features
~ Early signs (non specific): sudden fever, weakness, headache, muscle pains, loss of appetite, conjunctivitis
~ Late signs:
~ Diarrhoea (watery or bloody), vomiting
~ Mucosal and gastrointestinal bleeding: chest pain, respiratory distress, circulatory shock
~ CNS dysfunction, confusion, seizures
 
~ Miscarriage in pregnancy
~ Elevated AST and ALT, kidney injury, electrolyte abnormalities Note: Haemorrhage is seen in less than a third of Ebola patients Differential diagnosis
~ Malaria, rickettsiosis, meningitis ~ Shigellosis, typhoid
~ Anthrax, sepsis, viral hepatitis, dengue, leptospirosis Investigations
~ Send blood sample to a referral laboratory for specific testing (taking off blood samples from patients suspected of viral hemorrhagic fever should be done by a trained healthcare worker in appropriate PPE.

~ Notify district surveillance focal person Management

| ‰             | Notify the district health team |

Safety of health workers: maximum level of infection control procedures Health workers should maintain a high level of suspicion for Ebola virus disease. While standard precautions should be followed for all patients at all times, implementation of transmission-based precautions for cases suspected or confirmed to have Ebola or Marburg virus diseases is essential. This includes: screening for rapid identification and isolation of cases,
 
 Hand hygiene according to the WHO 5 moments safe injection practices use of personal protective equipment (e.g. eye protection, mask (medical or respirator), gloves, gown or coverall, head covering, apron and gum (rubber) boots. 

 Handling and disposing of all waste related to the care of an Ebola patients as infectious Safe handling and disinfection of linens (or disposal if not possible) 
and thorough cleaning and disinfection of the environment and medical equipment. 

 Disinfectants (e.g. chlorine mixture of 0.5% for surfaces) used must be prepared and used ensuring adequate concentration and contact time on surfaces.

 Handling of the deceased is particularly high risk and should be kept to a minimum. Strict adherence to IPC measures including hand hygiene, use of personal protective equipment (e.g. eye protection, mask (medical or respirator), gloves, gown or coverall, head covering, apron and gum (rubber) boots is required. 

Patient care Refer to the MoH recent guidelines for management of viral hemorrrhagic fevers Optimised Supportive treatment of signs and symptoms Replace and monitor fluids and electrolytes for patients with diarrhoea or vomiting Triage and contact tracing Triage patient (those who had contact with a patient or not)
 Contact identification, contact listing and contact follow up Dead Body handling Avoid washing or touching the dead f There should be no gathering at funerals. The dead should be buried promptly by a designated burial team Prevention
~ Health education of the population (e.g. avoid eating wild animals)
CHAPTER 2: Infectious Diseases
~ Effective outbreak communication and having haemorrhagic viral fever protocols in place
~ Appropriate safety gear for patients/health workers in suspect cases
~ Modification of burial practices ~ Use of condoms

## 2.3.6.2 Yellow Fever

An acute viral haemorrhagic fever transmitted through the bite of infected female Aedes aegypti mosquito. Incubation period is 3 to 6 days. It is a notifiable disease.

cause
~ Yellow fever RNA virus Risk factors
~ Residents in endemic area
~ Hunters and settlers around game parks Clinical features First stage:
~ Fever, chills, headache, backache, muscle pain, prostration, nausea, vomiting, fatigue. Usually resolves within 3-4 days.

## Second Stage:

~ About 15% of cases enter into a second or toxic stage after 1-2 day of remission: high fever, prostration, signs and symptoms of hepatic failure, renal failure and bleeding ( jaundice, nose bleeding, gingival bleeding, vomiting blood, blood in stool)
~ About half of these patients die within 7-10 days Differential diagnosis
~ Hepatitis E, liver failure
~ Malaria, Ebola 143 investigations
~ PCR in early phases ~ ELISA in the late stageIt is a notifiable disease.

## 2.3.7 Covid-19 Disease

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) results from infection with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is a novel virus in humans, knowledge of which and its pathogenesis still evolving. Additionally, the population-level immunity is uncertain. Complications of the severe infection can result in death.

144 
 

Early symptoms are non-specific and may include: fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue, shortness of breath, sore throat, headache, flu-like symptoms, diarrhea, nausea, respiratory distress, features of renal failure, pericarditis, and Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC).

It is important to know that many individuals with COVID-19 are asymptomatic. It is therefore paramount that all health workers observe strict infection prevention and control (IPC) measures at all times.

## Chapter 2: Infectious Diseases 2.4.1.1 Taeniasis (Tapeworm) Icd10 Code: B68

An infestation caused by Taenia (Taenia saginata (from undercooked beef ), Taenia solium (from undercooked pork), Diphyllobothrium latum (from undercooked fish).

## Cause

~ Adult Tapeworms: intestinal infestation, by ingestion of undercooked meat containing cysticerci (larval form of the worm)
~ Larvae forms (cysticercosis): by ingestion of food/water contaminated by eggs of T.solium. The eggs hatch in the intestine, the embryos invade the intestinal walls and disseminate in the brain, muscles or other organs

T. saginata, T.solium (adult tapeworm)
 Usually asymptomatic, but live segments may be passed Epigastric pain, diarrhoea, sometimes weight loss

## Cysticercosis

 Muscular: muscle pains, weakness, fever, subcutaneous nodules Neurocysticercosis: headache, convulsions, coma, meningoencephalitis, epilepsy Ocular: exophthalmia, strabismus, iritis

## D. Latum

 Usually asymptomatic, but mild symptoms may occur Megaloblastic anaemia may occur as a rare complication Differential diagnosis Other intestinal worm infestations Investigations Laboratory: eggs, worm segments in stool or collected from perianal skin (scotch tape method)

## 2.5.2 Malaria Icd10 Code: B50

Malaria is an acute febrile illness caused by infection with Plasmodium parasites and is transmitted from person to person by an infected female anopheles mosquito.

164 

## Cause

 There are five Plasmodium species of malaria parasites which infect humans namely: P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae and P. knowlesi.

 P. falciparum is the most virulent and also the most common malaria parasite in Uganda.

## Clinical Features Of Malaria

 It may be asymptomatic, mild illness (uncomplicated malaria) or severe illness (severe malaria)
 Intermittent fever is the most characteristic symptom of malaria. 

Three classical stages can be distinguished in a typical attack of malaria:
 The cold stage: the patient feels cold and shivers The hot stage: the patient feels hot The sweating stage: associated with sweating and relief of symptoms.

 A complete physical examination has to be performed in any patient presenting with fever or history of fever.

 When people are frequently exposed to malaria, they develop partial immunity. In such people, the classical stages of a malaria attack above may not be observed.

 Also, in people who have had partial treatment with antimalarial medicines, these classical stages may not be pronounced. 

## 2.5.2.1 Uncomplicated Malaria Icd 10 Code: B50.9

Common symptoms/signs of uncomplicated malaria
~ Fever: above 37.5°C (taken from the axilla ) or history of fever.

~ Loss of appetite, mild vomiting, diarrhoea
~ Weakness, headache, joint and muscle pain
~ Mild anaemia (mild pallor of palms and mucous membranes); occurs commonly in children.

~ Mild dehydration
~ Enlarged spleen (in acute malaria it may be minimally enlarged, soft and mildly tender)

## 2.5.2.2 Complicated/Severe Malaria Icd10 Code: B50.0, B50.8

It is an immediate threat to life and is therefore a medical emergency. Malaria is regarded as severe if there are asexual forms of P. falciparum in blood plus one or more of the following complications in the table below.

Investigations for Malaria Note: All suspected malaria patients MUST be tested by blood slide or RDT before they are treated. NOT all fevers are malaria.

 RDT or thick blood slide for diagnosis of malaria Random blood sugar and Hb level if clinically indicated Lumbar puncture: in case of convulsion/coma and negative malaria test
¾ Thin film for parasite identification Note on RDTs RDTs (Rapid Diagnostic tests) detect malaria antigen (not whole parasites like the blood slide) and remain positive for 2 to 3 weeks after effective treatment RDT do not become negative if the patient has already taken antimalarials RDTs are reliable, quick and easily accessible tools for malaria diagnosis.

A blood slide for microscopy is specifically recommended over RDT in the following situations:
¾ Patients who have completed antimalarial treatment and symptoms persist
¾ Patients who completed treatment but comes back within 3 weeks
¾ RDT negative patients without any other evident cause of fe-ver

Management of severe malaria

## General Principles

 Manage complications as recommended in the section below Manage fluids very carefully. Adults with severe malaria are very vunerable to fluid overload, while children are more likely to be dehydrated Monitor vitals signs carefully, including urine output. Intravenous artesunate is the medicine of choice
- At a health unit without admission and IV drug administration facilities, give a pre-referral dose of rectal artesunate* only recommended for children of 6 years and below( see dosing tables below) as soon as possible and refer for further management
- At a health unit with admission and IV drug administration facilities, treat with IV artesunate as in the table below
- If IV route is not possible, use IM route. - If Iv artesunate is not available, use IM artemether (into the thigh, never in the buttock) or IV quinine

Criteria for referral to regional/tertiary hospital
~ Persistent renal failure needing dialysis
~ Any complication that cannot be managed locally Management of RDT/Blood Smear Negative Ptients Patients who have a negative malaria test (most likely, if RDT is used) do not have malaria so other causes of fever have to be investigated for appropriate treatment.

CHAPTER 2: Infectious Diseases
~ Re-assess patient history, clinical signs and laboratory results. Consider other frequent causes of fever such as:
 If running nose, sore throat and cough: viral upper respiratory infection If swollen tonsils with exudate on it: tonsilitis If ear pain and discharge: otitis If cough, rapid breathing and difficulty in breathing: pneumonia If urinary symptoms: urinary tract infection If vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain: gastro-enteritis If skin rash: measles or other viral rash
~ If malaria is still suspected, investigate according to the flowchart below If signs/symptoms of severe malaria, RDT and blood slide negative but no other diagnosis is found, consider treating for malaria anyway but repeat RDTs after 24 hours to confirm.Also add a broad spectrum antibiotic If RDT and blood slide negative, no signs of other illness and no signs of severe sickness (patient has no danger signs) treat symptomatically with antipyretics, advise patient to return immediately if condition worsens or in 2 days if fever persists.

Possible reasons for false negative tests (test is negative but patient has malaria):
~ Low peripheral parasitaemia
~ Technical error in performing the test or test reagents that are out of date
~ Sequestration of parasites in the internal organs
~ Having already taken antimalarial drugs, inadequate or incomplete dose: this affects only microscopy, while RDT remains positive even if the patient has already taken an antimalarial using prophylactic treatment for malaria
 
 
Patient with negative blood smear or RDT
Is there evidence of 

![84_image_0.png](84_image_0.png)

non-malarial illness? 

![84_image_1.png](84_image_1.png)

Treat non-malarial illness Are there signs and symptoms suggestive of severe malaria?

![84_image_3.png](84_image_3.png)

Treat for severe disease with artesunate and broadspectrum antibiotics. Repeat testing (RDT) in 12-24 hours Withhold treatment for malaria, give symptomatic treatment and ask the patient to come back immediately if the illness becomes worse or if it persists for more than two days.

## 2.5.3.4 Malaria Prophylaxis

Not recommended for all those living in a highly endemic area like Uganda. However, it is recommended for certain high-risk groups but is not 100% effective CHAPTER 2: Infectious Diseases

## 2.5.3.5 Malaria Prevention And Control

Give effective treatment and prophylaxis
~ Eliminate parasites from the human population by early diagnosis and effective treatment
~ Protect vulnerable groups with chemoprophylaxis ~ Give IPT to all pregnant women Reduce human-mosquito contact
~ Use insecticide-treated materials (e.g. bed nets)
~ Destroy adult mosquitoes by indoor residual spraying of dwellings with insecticide or use of knock-down sprays
~ Screen houses ~ Carefully select house sites avoiding mosquito-infested areas
~ Wear clothes which cover the arms and legs and use repellent mosquito coils and creams/sprays on the skin when sitting outdoors at night Control mosquito breeding sites
~ Eliminate collections of stagnant water where mosquitoes breed, e.g. in empty cans/ containers, potholes, old car tyres, plastic bags, and footprints by disposal, draining, or covering with soil or sand
~ Destroy mosquito larvae by dosing stagnant water bodies with larvicides or with biological methods (e.g. larvae- eating fish)
Give public health education on the above measures include the need for self testing (self-care) using RDT before any medication.

## 2.5.4 Human African Trypanosomiasis (Sleeping Sickness) Icd10 Code: B56

A disease caused by trypanosomes (a protozoa) and transmitted to humans by several species of tsetse fly

## Cause

~ Trypanosoma rhodesiense (mostly in the Central and Eastern regions of Uganda)
~ Trypanosoma gambiense (mostly in West Nile region) ~ Clinical features
~ May be history of tsetse fly bite and swelling at site of bite after 7-14 days (more often in T. rhodesiense, rarely in T. Gambiense)
T. Rhodesiense
~ Incubation is 2-3 weeks
~ Early stage (haemolymphatic stage): headache not responding to common analgesics, fever, generalised lymphadenopathy, joint pains
~ Late stage (meningoencephalitis stage): after some weeks, neurological and psychiatric symptoms like apathy, day sleepiness, paralysis, seizures
~ If not treated: cachexia, lethargy, coma and death within 3-6 months

## T. Gambiense

~ Similar to the rhodesiense but less acute and with slower progression
~ Incubation can last several years Differential diagnosis
~ Malaria, meningitis ~ TB, HIV/AIDS
Investigations Blood: Slides for trypanosomes CSF: For trypanosomes, lymphocyte count Aspirate from chancre/lymph node: for trypanosomes Management This is based on the findings of the CSF analysis, determining the stage of disease. To determine the medicine of choice, the disease is divided into two stages: early and late stage

~ Corticosteroids: Should be given to patients with late trypanosomiasis on melarsoprol who may have
~ hypoadrenalism - the steroids may also reduce any drug reactions
~ Do not give hydrocortisone after day 24, even though the melarsoprol treatment is not yet complete
~ If prednisolone is used instead of hydrocortisone, the anti-inflammatory action is similar but the correction of the hypoadrenalism will be much less marked
~ Suramin: Do not use this medicine for early or late stage T. gambiense treatment in onchocerciasis-endemic areas as it may cause blindness in any onchocerciasis-infected patients by killing the filariae in the eye Prevention
~ Trapping of tsetse flies
~ Clearing of bushes around homes and paths
~ Early detection and treatment of cases

HIV/AIDS and Sexually Transmitted 3Infections

![0_image_0.png](0_image_0.png)

Always refer to the latest Ministry of Health PMTCT, ART, and STI 
Guidelines for the management of HIV and Sexually Transmitted Infections. This section has been adapted from the "current Consolidated guidelines for prevention and treatment of HIV in Uganda".

## 3.1 Hiv Infection And Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (Aids) Icd 10 Code: B20

Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a condition of reduced immunity as a result of infection with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). HIV should be confirmed with an HIV test.

Test and Treat policy Uganda has adopted the "Test and Treat Policy", which involves providing lif long antiretroviral therapy (ART) to ALL people living with HIV irrespective of CD4 count or clinical staging.

Causes
~ Human Immunodeficiency Virus Modes of transmission
~ Sexual intercourse with an HIV-infected person
~ Transfusion with HIV-infected blood
~ Mother-To-Child Transmission during pregnancy, delivery, or through breastfeeding
~ HIV-contaminated sharp instruments, e.g., dental and surgical equipment, needles, scalpels, razors, hair shaving equipment, nail cutters, and other sharp objects
~ Exposure to HIV-infected materials through an open wound or cut Epidemiological risk factors for HIV
~ Present or past high-risk behaviour (multiple sexual partners)
~ Loss of a spouse or partner from HIV disease
~ Having sexually transmitted infections, especially Herpes simplex virus type 2
~ Being an uncircumcised man
~ Being in an HIV-discordant sexual relationship or marriage
~ History of blood transfusion between 1975 and 1986

## 3.1.1 Clinical Features Of Hiv

The WHO Clinical Staging of HIV for adults and children in the tables below shows the typical clinical features of HIV infection. The staging is based on demonstration of one or more opportunistic infections or key findings and correlates with disease progression and prognosis. Clinical staging should be performed at HIV diagnosis, on entry into HIV care, at ART initiation and at every visit hereafter to help guide patient care and monitor disease progress.

## 3.1.2 **Diagnosis And Investigations Of Hiv**

HIV testing is the point of entry into comprehensive care HIV services. The aim of HIV testing services (HTS) is to promptly identify HIV status to ensure early linkage to prevention, treatment, and support services. Early diagnosis is fundamental for early treatment, good prognosis and reduction in transmission. HTS should be availed to all persons at risk of HIV infection using cost-effective and high-impact approaches. HTS should be differentiated to subpopulations and geographical locations because less than 20% of PLHIV aged 15 years and above do not know their status. Uganda is currently implementing targeted HIV testing to optimize HIV case identification and linkage to care. People at high risk of HIV acquisition include: being in a sexual relationship with multiple concurrent partners; belonging to a key, vulnerable or priority population (e.g., children, adolescent girls and young women, pregnant or breastfeeding women); being a sexual contact to an index client; being a biological child to an HIV positive client; not knowing your partner's HIV status; or being in a serodiscordant relationship.

The following approaches are utilized in targeted HIV testing.

1. Screening for HIV testing eligibility for children, adolescents and adults 2. Index client testing (ICT), including Assisted Partner notification (APN) and testing for biological children/ Know Your Child Status (KYCS). 3. Social Network Strategy (SNS) 4. HIV Self-Testing (HIVST) Pre and post counselling and consent are needed except in the following situations:
 Diagnostic testing: test carried out on very sick, unconscious, symptomatic or mentall ill by attending health care team for the purpose of better patient management Routine testing: for individuals likely to pose a risk of HIV infection to others e.g. pregnant and breastfeeding mothers, sexual offenders and survivors, blood or body tissue or organ donors. Individuals tested using this appraoch must be given an opportunity to know their status If a patient is positive, he/she must be IMMEDIATELY connected to HIV care services.

In adults and children >18 months, testing is based on serological (antibody) testing. Due to the window period between infection and production of detectable levels of antibodies, patients who are negative should be re-tested after three months if they had a possible exposure in the 3 months before the test.

Serological testing is available from HC2 level. In children below 18 months, testing is virological, that is based on direct detection of viral DNA (DNA-PCR). Virological testing (DNA-PCR and viral load) is done on DBS (dried blood spots) samples which can be collected from HC2 and are sent to a central national laboratory through the hub system.

HIV testing in children less than 18 months The recommended test for children <18 months is virological (DNA-PCR) testing, since antibody tests will detect antibodies passed to the child from the mother (so the test can give a false positive). If the mother is HIV negative: f The child is classified as HIV negative If the mother is positive: Do DNA PCR at 6 weeks of age or at an earlier opportunity thereafter Start cotrimoxazole prophylaxis and Niverapine syrup till HIV status is confirmed for the child If PCR is positive, enroll child for ART If PCR is negative and child never breasted the child is negative.

 Stop cotrimoxazole and Niverapine.

 Follow up every 3 months and do HIV rapid test (serological) at 18 months.

 If PCR is negative BUT child is breastfeeding/has breasfed in the last 6 weeks, re-check PCR 6 weeks after cessation of breastfeeding.

If mother's status is unknown:
 Test the mother and continue management according to the result If mother unavailable:
 Perform rapid antibody testing on the child. The result will give indication on the mother's status:
- If the test is negative: child negative - If the test is positive, follow algorithm for managing a child from a HIV positive mother.

| CD4                | It measures the level of CD4 T lymphocytes, a subtype white blood cell. It  reflects the level of compromise of the  immune system. It is used for initial assessment pre ART and for monitoring  of ART effect.                                                                                                                                             | HC2       |
| Viral Load         | It measures the quantity of virus in the  blood. It is used to monitor the effect  of ARVs. It is currently done by DBS  (Dried Blood Spot) |           |
| Genot ype  Testing | HIV genotypic resistance test is a qualitative test that detects mutations associated with ARV drug resistance. The test  evaluates if the HIV strain infecting the  individual has developed resistance to  one or more ARV drugs. This is useful  in identifying a combination of ARVs to  which the HIV strain is susceptible                                                                                                                                             |           |

- If an infant with a Negative previous PCR is symptpmatic while still breastfeeding, take off a PCR sample at that point in time. If negative, another PCR sample must be taken according to the algorithm either 9 konths or 6bweeks after breastfeeding• If monther' status cannot be ascertained, may use rapid test in bables to determine HIV exposure status, should perform DNA PCR for baby who is symptomatic, mainourished or has TB as routine• If breastfeeding is stopped before 9 months then a final DNA PCR can be done at any point 6 weeks after cessation of breastfeeding.• For infants whose mothers are filling on any regimen: take off 2 DBS at the time of confirming the positive test - one for confirmation and one for HIVDR tseting

## 3.1.3 **Measures Before Arv Treatment**

Even without the use of specific ARV treatment, there are many ways in which good HIV management can help patients:

| Preventing HIV transmission                                   | adopt safer sexual practices including abstinence, correct and consistent condom use. Condom use  prevents HIV transmission, reduces  risk of other STIs, and prevents  unintended pregnancies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Disclosure and partner  testing   | PLHIV should actively explore ways  of disclosing their HIV status to  sexual partners, family members  and significant others. Offer provider- and/or counselor-mediated or  supported disclosure as options for  those who do not feel comfortable  disclosing on their own.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Family planning                   | Encourage PLHIV to discuss their  reproductive choices and support  them to adopt those which do not  compromise their health. For women  who choose to conceive, link them  to eMTCT services.                                                                                               |
| Alcohol and other risk  reduction | Educate on risks of alcohol abuse  leading to poor treatment adherence  resulting in disease progression,  and the likelihood of engaging in  risky sexual behaviours, placing  themselves at increased risk for  acquiring STIs and placing their  negative partners at risk for  infection. |

# 3.1.4 General Principles Of Antiretroviral Treatment (Art)

Assessment of patient's history
~ Level of understanding of HIV/AIDS
~ Length of time since the diagnosis of HIV infection ~ Demographics and lifestyle: whether employed and nature of work
~ History of previous ART 
~ Pregnancy risks: contraception options and choices, current or planned pregnancy, access to contraceptive services
~ Sexual risks and disclosure: willingness to practice safer sex, disclosure of HIV serostatus, use of condoms, HIV counselling, and testing of sex partners and children
~ Symptoms of chronic pain and depression
~ History of opportunistic infections and other significant illnesses e.g. TB and STIs, hospitalisations, and surgeries
~ Current medications (including anti-TB drugs, traditional therapies, etc.)
Physical exam
~ Weight ~ Nutritional status
~ Functional capacity and level of disability
~ Vital signs, skin, eyes, oropharynx (presence of thrush), 
lymph nodes, lungs, heart, abdomen, genital tract (STIs), extremities, nervous system Baseline laboratory tests to assess immunosuppression and disease aggressiveness
~ Confirming HIV serostatus
~ CD4 testing
~ Pregnancy test
~ Full blood count particularly for patients starting on a AZT-containing regimen Baseline Labs to assess general health and diagnose any pre-existing HIV complications
~ Sputum smear for AFB for patients who have coughed for 
> 2-3 weeks and a chest X-ray for patients who have unproductive cough or whose AFB smears are negative
~ Urine analysis for proteinuria, particularly for patients starting on TDF-containing regimen
~ Syphilis and Hepatitis B screening ~ Liver and renal function tests if available
~ Cryptococcal antigen and urine LAM screening for patients whose CD4 count is < 200 cells/ml
~ Symptom-directed lab tests to diagnose pre-existing illnesses Staging of disease
~ Using WHO clinical criteria (see tables above) Counselling and assessment of patient's readiness to start therapy
~ Assess for education, information or counselling support needs
~ Develop an adherence plan Goals of treatment with antiretroviral medicines are to:
~ Inhibit viral replication as reflected in plasma HIV concentration to as low as possible and for as long as possible. 

This promotes restoration of the immune system.

~ Preserve or enhance the immune function (CD4 restoration), which prevents/delays the clinical progression of HIV disease
~ Minimise toxicities and side effects associated with the medicines 201 
~ Improve quality of life and reduce HIV-related morbidity and mortality
~ Promote growth and neurological development in children Tools to achieve the goals of therapy
~ Maximisation of adherence to ART: adequate support to patient to adhere to treatment and/or access to community/
facility level adherence counselling
~ - Disclosure of HIV serostatus reinforces patient's adherence to ART
~ Rational sequencing of medicines to preserve future treatment options
~ Use of ARV medicine resistance testing when appropriate and available
~ Use of viral load estimates for monitoring

## Principles Of Art

~ Antiretroviral therapy is part of comprehensive HIV care. 

The guiding principles of good ART include:
~ Efficacy and durability of the chosen medicine regimens
~ Freedom from serious adverse effects; low toxicity
~ Ease of administration including no food restrictions, better palatability, and lower pill burden
~ Affordability and availability of medicines and medicine combinations
~ Organised sequencing - spares other available formulations for use in second line while allowing for harmonisation of regimens across age and population
~ Ongoing support of the patient to maintain adherence

## Limitations Of Art

~ Antiretroviral medicines are not a cure for HIV but greatly improve quality of life when used appropriately
~ ARVs are relatively expensive, require an adequate infrastructure, and knowledgeable healthcare workers
~ Medicine interactions and resistance may decrease the potency of ARVs
~ Patients may develop adverse medicine reactions
~ Patients have to take at least 95% of their pills in order to respond well (adherence is key to successful therapy)
~ The medications have to be taken for life
~ Some patients may not respond (benefit) to treatment and continue to regress in spite of high adherence
~ Children are dependent on adults for adherence to ART

## Available Medicines For Art

At present, antiretroviral medicines come in six classes, which attack different sites and stages of the HIV life cycle, thereby interfering with its reproduction.

Initiation of ART
Evidence and programmatic experience have shown that early initiation of ART results in reduced mortality, morbidity and HIV transmission outcomes. However, priority should be given to patients with lower CD4 counts as well as those who are symptomatic.

A CD4 count is not necessary for initiation but should be used to identify patients with advanced HIV disease.

## Art In Children

The vast majority (about 90%) of infants and children with HIV acquire the infection through mother-to-child transmission. HIV infection follows a more aggressive course among infants and children than among adults; 30% die by age 1 year and 50% die by age 2 years without access to life-saving medicines, including ART and preventive interventions, such as cotrimoxazole prophylaxis.

Early HIV diagnosis and ARV treatment is critical for infants. A significant number of lives can be saved by initiating ART for HIV-positive infants immediately after diagnosis within the first 12 weeks of life.

General principles
~ ARV doses need to be adjusted from time to time as the children grow quickly and thus, their weight changes.

~ Before a child begins ART, the following assessments must be made:
 Readiness of parents/caretakers or child (if older) to start ART
 Complete pre-treatment baseline assessment (see previous sections)
Process of initiating ART
Health workers should do the following before initiating ART: Assess all clients for any evidence of opportunistic infections (OIs). If the patient has TB or cryptococcal meningitis, ART should be deferred and initiated after starting treatment of these OIs. For patients without TB or cryptococcal meningitis, offer ART on the same day through an opt-out approach. In this approach, patients should be prepared and assessed for readiness to start ART on the same day.

 
If a client is ready, ART should be initiated on the same day. If a client is not ready or opts out of same-day initiation, a timely ART preparation plan should be agreed upon with the aim of initiating ART within seven days for children and pregnant women, and within one month for adults.

## 3.1.5 Recommended First Line Regimens In Adults, Adolescents, Pregnant Women And Children

HIV management guidelines are constantly being updated according to evidence and public policy decisions. Always refer to the latest official guidelines.

The 2022 guidelines recommend DOLUTEGRAVIR (DTG) an integrase inhibitor as the anchor ARV in the preferred first and second-line treatment regimens for all HIV infected clients; children, adolescents, men, women (including pregnant women, breastfeeding women, adolescent girls and women of child bearing potential).

ART regimens in children are age and weight dependent. When children grow, doses and regimens have to be changed according to the guidelines below.

## 3.1.6 Monitoring Of Art

The purpose of monitoring patients on ART is to assess:
~ Response to ART and early detection of treatment failure
~ Side effects and toxicity
~ Adherence The schedule of monitoring visits follow a pre-set calendar for the 1st one year after initiation of ART, i.e:
 At 1, 2 and 3 months from start of ART
 At 6, 9, 12 months After 12 months from initiation of ART, the Differentiated Model of Care Delivery is followed, in which schedule and modalities of periodic checks are based on individual needs and characteristics of the patient. The aim of this model is:
 A client centered approach, so that stable patients have spaced checks and fast tracks drug pick ups More efficient use of resources by avoiding overcrowding and long waiting times More focus on unstable/complex patients
(Refer to MOH HIV/ART guidelines for more details).

## 3.1.8 Recommended Second Line Regimens In Adults, Adolescents, Pregnant Women And Children

Patients may need to be switched to second line regimens in case of treatment failure, and to third line if they fail on second line drugs. Third line regimens require resistancetesting to inform the choice of appropriate drugs, and needs referral to specialised ART centres. 

Factors involved in treatment failure are poor adherence, inadequate drug levels or prior existing drug resistance.

Before switching therapy, it is essential to assess and address adherence issues, and provide intensive adherence counselling if necessary.

Criteria for defining treatment failure are presented in the following table:

- All PLHIV should receive resistance testing to inform the prescription of 2ndand 3rd-line medicines.• Since all 3rd-line PLHIV will have prior PI Exposure, DRV/r will be taken twice a day.• For recipients of care on NNRTI-based First Line regimen whose VL is not suppressed, switch without a second VL but conduct IAC to improve adherence to new regimen.• For all PLHIV failing first-line ART, optimize the second-line ART using HIVDR test

1. For children≥10kg that are able to swallow tablets, give LPV/r 100/25mg tablet.

2. tablets of LPV/r 100/25mg can be substituted with 1 tablet of LPV/r 200/50mg in order to reduce the pill burden. These tablets should be administered fully intact/whole i.e. not cut or crushed.

3. DRV must be administered with 0.5mL of RTV 80mg/mL oral suspension in children <15kg, with 2 tab of RTV 25mg in children 15 to 25kg and 3 tab of RTV 25mg in children above 25kg. DRV is always taken with food.

4. DRV 600mg must be co-administered with RTV 100mg.

## 3.1.9 Mother-To-Child Transmission Of Hiv

Approximately one-third of the women who are infected with HIV can pass it to their babies.

Cause Time of transmission
~ During pregnancy (15-20%)
~ During time of labour and delivery (60%-70%)
~ After delivery through breast feeding (15%-20%)
Pre-disposing factors
~ High maternal viral load ~ Depleted maternal immunity (e.g. very low CD4 count)
~ Prolonged rupture of membranes
~ Intra-partum haemorrhage and invasive obstetrical procedures
~ If delivering twins, first twin is at higher risk of infection than second twin
~ Premature baby is at higher risk than term baby
~ Mixed feeding carries a higher risk than exclusive breastfeeding or use of replacement feeding Investigations Blood: HIV serological test HIV DNA PCR testing of babies (see algorithm in section 3.1.2 above)
 Viral load testing every 6 months Management All HIV services for pregnant mothers are offered in the MCH clinic. After delivery, mother and baby will remain in the MCH postnatal clinic till HIV status of the child is confirmed, then they will be transferred to the general ART clinic.

The current policy aims at elimination of Mother-to-Child Transmission (eMTCT) through provision of a continuum of care with the following elements:
- Primary HIV prevention for men, women and adolescents - Prevention of unintended pregnancies among women living with HIV
- Prevention of HIV transmission from women living with HIV 
to their infants
- Provision of treatment, care and support to ALL women infected with HIV, their children and their families

| Antenatal care package for all pregnant  women (regardless  of HIV status)           | - All pregnant women/girls should have  at least eight ANC visits: encourage and  support mothers to start ANC in the first  trimester - Routinely provide iron, folic acid, and multivitamin supplements - Deworm in the 2nd trimester using Mebendazole - Provide nutrition assessment, counseling  and support  - Counsel and encourage women to deliver at  the health facility •Screen for TB and take appropriate action •Take weight and BP at every visit   | 233 |

| Service   | Description Laboratory services: •Screen and treat for syphilis, HIV, hepatitis  B, other STIs and anemia. Use syndromic  approach to treating STIs •Perform urinalysis to detect a urinary tract  infection (UTI), protein in the urine (proteinuria), or blood in the urine (hematuria)  indicating kidney damage, or sugar in urine  suggesting diabetes •Do a blood slide for malaria for all pregnant women. •Perform a blood group test in anticipation  of blood transfusion and check for hereditary conditions if suspected (sickling test) •For HIV-positive women, perform a  baseline CD4 count. The test result is not  required for ART initiation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| ART       | o All women/girls living with HIV identified  during pregnancy, labour and delivery or  while breastfeeding should be started on  lifelong ART  o ART should be initiated on the same day,  and adherence counseling should be initiated and sustained intensively for the first  three months then maintained for life. o Initiate mother on once-daily FDC of TDF+3TC+DTG with pharmacovigilance  o The mothers initiated on TDF + 3TC  +EFV400 shall be transitioned to TDF +  3TC + DTG at 6-9 months post-partum if  VL within past 6 months is suppressed.  o If mother is already on ART >6 months  with TDF/3TC/EFV, do VL test. If she  is virally suppressed, maintain her on  TDF/3TC/EFV400 until 6-9 months after  delivery and then substitute EFV with DTG  if VL within the past 6 months is suppressed. o If she is already on a DTG-based 1st-line  regimen and virally suppressed, maintain  on the same regimen. o If she is already on ART and VL is not  suppressed, manage as treatment failure  and switch to DTG-based 2nd line regimen  (if no previous exposure to DTG).               |

| ART       | o If she is on 2ndline ART with ATV/r or  LPV/r and virally suppressed, maintain on  the same regimen until 6-9 months after  delivery and then substitute PI with DTG if  VL within the past 6 months is suppressed  and no previous exposure to DTG. o All women should receive Pre-ART adherence counseling before initiating ART and  ongoing adherence support after that o ART should be initiated and maintained in  mother-baby care point in MCH. What to do if mum refuses ART or if you  know adherence is poor: Maternal VL suppression is key for preventing breastfeeding transmission, so if VL  suppression is not certain infant prophylaxis may serve as a "back up" to prevent  MTCT - similar to "Option A". Clinical  providers should continue infant prophylaxis with NVP for these specific scenarios. Continuation of prophylaxis should be  seen as an interim measure while maternal  adherence is improved •Encourage consistent and correct condom                                                                                                                                                                       |     |

| Identification of  HIV-exposed infants           | - Identify all HIV-exposed infants; document the  HIV status of the mother in the child card and  mothers' passport. Infants whose HIV status  is not documented or is unknown should be  offered rapid HIV testing; including those whose  mothers did not receive eMTCT services or have  become newly infected after pregnancy. Rapid  diagnostic tests for HIV serology can be used  to assess HIV exposure among infants younger  than four months of age. HIV-exposure status  among infants and children 4–18 months of age  should therefore be ascertained by HIV serological testing the mother. The mother should be  tested every 3 months until end of breastfeeding.  The entry points for identification of HIV-exposed infants include YCC, OPD pediatric/ Nutrition/TB wards and outreaches. Special attention should be paid during immunization both  at static and outreach areas to ensure that all  children have their exposure status ascertained.               |

|           | - HIV-infected infants and children can safely  receive most childhood vaccines if given at the  right time. All HIV-infected and exposed children should be immunized as per EPI immunization schedule. - Health workers should review child immunization status at every visit - Some special considerations/modifications for  HIV-exposed children: o BCG: When considering BCG vaccination at a  later age (re-vaccination for no scar or missed  earlier vaccination), exclude symptomatic HIV  infection. Children with symptomatic HIV infection should not receive BCG. o Measles: Although the measles vaccine is a  live vaccine, it should be given at six and nine  months even when the child has symptoms of  HIV. The measles illness from the vaccine is  milder than that from the wild measles virus,  which is more severe and likely to cause death. o Yellow Fever: Do not give yellow fever vaccine  to symptomatic HIV-infected children; asymptomatic children in endemic areas should receive  the vaccine at nine months of age                                                            |                                                                                  |

## 3.1.9.3 **Care Of Hiv Exposed Infant**

HIV-exposed infants should receive care at the mother-baby care point together with their mothers until they are 18 months of age. The goals of HIV-exposed infant care services are:
~ To prevent the infant from being HIV infected
~ Among those who get infected: to diagnose HIV infection early and treat
~ Offer child survival interventions to prevent early death from preventable childhood illnesses The HIV Exposed Infant and the mother should consistently visit the health facility at least nine times during that period.

The visits are synchronised with the child's immunisation schedule (i.e., at 6, 10 and 14 weeks, then at 5, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 months).

## Counselling On Infant Feeding Choice

- Explain the risks of HIV transmission by breastfeeding (15%) 
and other risks of not breastfeeding (malnutrition, diarrhoea)
- Mixed feeding may also increase risk of HIV transmission - and diarrhoea - Tell her about options for feeding, advantages, and risks - Help her to assess choices, decide on the best option, and then support her choice
- Feeding options - Recommended option: Exclusive breastfeeding then complementary feeding after child is six months old
- Exclusive breastfeeding stopping at 3-6 months old if - replacement feeding possible after this - If replacement feeding introduced early, mother must stop breastfeeding
- Replacement feeding with home-prepared formula or commercial formula and then family foods (provided this is acceptable, feasible, safe, and sustainable/ affordable)
If mother chooses breastfeeding
- The risk may be reduced by keeping the breasts healthy 
(mastitis and cracked nipples raise HIV infection risk)
- Advise exclusive breastfeeding for 3-6 months If mother chooses replacement feeding Counsel and teach her on safe preparation, hygiene, amounts, times to feed the baby etc.

 Follow up within a week from birth and at any visit to health facility.

## 3.1.10 Opportunistic Infections In Hiv

3.1.10.1 **Tuberculosis and HIV Co-Infection**
Active TB may be present when ART needs to be initiated or it may develop during treatment.

TB and HIV care for co-infected patients should be provided in an integrated manner under one roof by one care team (one-stop-shop).

Co-management of TB and HIV is complicated by:
~ Drug interactions between rifampicin and both the NNRTI 
and PI classes
~ Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)
~ Pill burden, overlapping toxicities and adherence issues.

ART should be initiated in all TB/HIV co-infected people irrespective of their clinical stage or CD4 count. However, the timing of initiation of treatment may differ based on whether the patient is diagnosed with TB before or after initiating ART.

Second line ART for patients with TB
~ There are significant drug interactions with PIs and rifampicin.

~ If rifabutin is available, it may be used in place of rifampicin with ATV/r or LPV/r, but it is contraindicated in patients with WBC counts below 1000/mm3.

~ Maintaining PI in second line regimens while switching from 

## Tb Prevention

~ BCG immunisation: it protects children against severe forms of TB. It can be given at birth. If delayed, avoid in symptomatic HIV
~ IPT (Isoniazid Preventive Treatment) (see section 5.3.2.3)

## 3.1.10.2 **Cryptococcal Meningitis** Icd10 Code: B45

Crytococcal meningitis is an opportunistic infection caused by a fungus Cryptococcus neoformans.

~ In Uganda, cryptococcal meningitis (CM) associated mortality is up to 39%. Patients with a CD4 cell count of <100 are at the highest risk, so early screening and management is critical.

~ Screening In ART-Naive Patients
~ Screen routinely for Cryptococcal Meningitis with the cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) test (a bedside finger prick test):
- All ART naive individuals with CD4 <100 cells/µL - Patients on ART with viral load (VL >1000 copies/ml) or clinical (stage 3 or 4 disease) failure
~ If serum CrAg negative and no signs of meningitis: start ART immediately (or switch regimen)
~ If CrAg positive and/or signs or symptoms of meningitis 
(headache, presence of seizures, altered consciousness, photophobia, neck stiffness, and a positive Kernigs' sign)
- Perform lumbar puncture and test for CSF CrAg (culture if possible)
~ If CSF CrAg positive, diagnose and treat for Cryptococcal Meningitis
~ If CSF CrAg negative but blood CrAg positive, give pre emptive treatment for asymptomatic cryptococcal disease or non CNS cryptococcal disease255

Decision on which ART regimen to restart should be made according to patient's history, ART guidelines, HIV viral and genotypic resistance testing if possible. If it is considered likely that the patient has developed resistance to 1stline ARVs, then restart with 2ndline containing boosted PI or DTG is possible. ** Unless documented to have a suppressed viral load at time of admission or within the month prior to admission, in which case continue ART

Evaluate for drug resistance: Send CSF to Central Public Health  Laboratory (CPHL) for culture and sensitivity testing, if there  are no drug resistance results, re-initiate the induction therapy  for two weeks and complete other phases of treatment. Adequate control of elevated CSF pressure - Control of increased intracranial pressure improves survival  by 25% in persons with Cryptococcal Meningitis. - All patients with a CSF Pressure >250mm H2O will need a  therapeutic LP the following day to reduce the CSF pressure  to <200 mm. - In the absence of a manometer, one may use an IV giving  set to create an improvised manometer measuring the height  with a meter stick. Removing 20-30mL of CSF (even in the absence of a manometer)  may be adequate to decrease CSF pressure. Most patients  will need 2-3LPs during the induction phase. |                                                             |                                                                                                                                                       |          |

## 3.1.10.3 **Hepatitis B And Hiv Co-Infection Icd10 Code: B18**

~ Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the leading cause of chronic liver disease among HIV patients. In Uganda, the prevalence of Hepatitis B among HIV patients is estimated to be at 17%. (see section 6.5.2 for more details on hepatitis B infection)
~ All HIV-infected patients initiating and those failing ART 
should be routinely screened for HBV infection using Hep B surface Antigen (HBsAg)
~ People living with HIV with a positive HBsAg should have other complementary tests at baseline and repeated every 6 months and these include:
 A complete blood count Liver function tests: ALT, AST, albumin, bilirubin, PT-INR
 Liver ultrasound scan: to assess stage of liver fibrosis
~ Repeat tests every 6 months since patients with chronic HBV infection are at increased risk for hepatocellular carcinoma

## Management Of Hbv/Hiv Co-Infection

The goal of HBV/HIV treatment is to prevent dual disease progression and to reduce HBV-related morbidity and mortality

## Prevention Of Hbv Infection

~ Counseling: emphasize sexual transmission as well as the risks associated with sharing needles and syringes, tattooing or body-piercing
~ Advise patients with chronic HBV disease to avoid alcohol consumption
~ All household members and sexual partners of people living with HIV with HBV should be screened for HBsAG
~ HBV Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent HBV 
infection and its consequences
- All HIV-infected patients who test negative on HBsAg - should be vaccinated with HBV vaccine - All sexual partners and contacts should receive HBV 
vaccination regardless of whether they are HIV-infected or not
 

## 3.1.10.4 **Pneumocystis Pneumonia** Icd10 Code: B59

Interstitial pneumonitis caused by the parasite Pneumocystis jirovecii (formerly carinii). It is common in severely immunosuppresed patients (e.g. in HIV).

~ Clinical features
~ Fever ~ Dry cough
~ Shortness of breath (significant hypoxemia)
~
Investigations Chest x-ray shows characteristic bilateral interstitial infiltrates

## 3.1.10.5 **Other Diseases**

People living with HIV are at higher risk of acquiring any other infection and diseases, including non-communicable diseases, due to HIV itself and drug side effects.

- Treat any other infection (e.g. malaria, STI) as per guidelines for the general population
- Screen regularly for NCD (diabetes, hypertension and - depression) - Screen women at enrolment in HIV care and then annually for cervical cancer using Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid (VIA) (see section 12.2.2)

## 3.1.11 Prevention Of Hiv

Behavioural change
~ Always follow safe sex practices (e.g. use condoms; avoid multiple sexual partners)
~ Never share used needles, syringes, razors, hair shavers, nail cutters, and other sharp objects 264 
~ Avoid tattooing, body-piercing, and scarification unless carried out under strictly hygienic conditions in properly controlled premises
~ Delay start of sexual activity in adolescence
~ Discourage cross generational and transactional sex ~ Avoid violence and abuse Biomedical prevention interventions
~ PMTCT
~ Safe Male Circumcision
~ ART with viral suppression
~ PEP (Post Exposure Prophylaxis)
~ PrEP (Pre Exposure Prophylaxis)
~ Blood transfusion safety
~ STI screening and treatment ~ Safe infusion and injection practices
~ Adherence to infection control procedures

## 3.1.11.1 Post-Exposure Prophylaxis Icd10 Code: Z20.6

Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is the short-term use of ARVs to reduce the likelihood of acquiring HIV infection after potential occupational or non-occupational exposure.

Types of Exposure
~ Occupational exposures: Occur in health care settings and include sharps and needlestick injuries or splashes of body fluids to the skin and mucous membranes
~ Non-occupational exposures: Include unprotected sex, exposure following assault like in rape & defilement, road traffic accidents and injuries at construction sites where exposure to body fluids occur 265 Steps in providing PEP

## 3.1.11.2 Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (Prep)

Oral Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)
Definition: PrEP is the use of ARV drugs by HIV uninfected persons to prevent the acquisition of HIV before exposure to HIV. Table below describes processes involved in offering PrEP.

The process of providing pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)

| Process                    | Description   |
|----------------------------|---------------|
| Screening for risk  of HIV | PrEP provides an effective additional biomedical prevention  option for HIV-negative people at substantial risk of acquiring  HIV infection. These include people who: a) Live in discordant sexual relationships  b) Have had unprotected vaginal sexual intercourse with  more than one partner of unknown HIV status in the  past six months  c) Have had anal sexual intercourse in the past six months d) Have had sex in exchange for money, goods or a service  in the last six months e) Use or abuse of drugs especially injectable drugs in the  last six months f) Have had more than one episode of a STI within the  last twelve months g) Are part of a discordant couple, especially if the  HIV-positive partner is not on ART or has been on  ART for less than six months or not virally suppressed. h) Recurrent post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) users. (Recurrent implies PEP use more than 3 times a years).  i) Are members of key or priority populations who are  unable or unwilling to achieve consistent use of condoms.               |

| Process                         | Description NB: Eligibility is likely to be more prevalent in populations  such as discordant couple, sex workers, fisher folk,  long-distance truck drivers, men who have sex with  men (MSM), uniformed forces, and adolescents and  young women including pregnant and lactating AGYW  at substantial risk. After meeting the substantial risk for HIV criteria:   |                                                                                                                                       |              |        |       |     |

## The Prep Ring

The PrEP ring is a long-acting HIV prevention method developed specifically for clients who are unable or do not want to take oral PrEP or when oral PrEP is not available. The ring is made of a flexible silicone material containing 25 mg of an ARV drug called dapivirine. It is inserted into the vagina and should remain in place for one month. Dapivirine belongs to a class of ARVs called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) that reduce the ability of HIV to replicate itself inside a healthy cell. The ring delivers the drug directly to the site of potential infection over the course of one month, with low absorption elsewhere in the body, lowering the likelihood of systemic side effects.

## Possible Side Effects Of The Prep Ring

Possible side effects of the ring are typically mild and include urinary tract infections (UTIs - experienced by about 15% of users), vaginal discharge (experienced by about 7% of users), vulvar itching (experienced by about 6% of users), and pelvic and lower abdominal pain (experienced by about 6% of users).

Contraindications for PrEP Ring Use The ring should not be provided to people with:
 An HIV-positive test result according to the national HIV testing algorithm Known exposure to HIV in the past 72 hours (because such clients may derive more benefit from post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) if the potential for HIV exposure was high)
 Signs of AHI (Box 1) AND potential exposure within the past 14 days Inability to commit to effectively using the ring and attend scheduled follow-up visits Allergy or hypersensitivity to active substance or other substances listed in the product information sheet

## Long Acting Injectable Cabotegravir (Cab-La)

The long acting injectable cabotegravir: Is a long acting injectable drug containing Cabotegravir, an integrase inhibitor, is effective in preventing HIV among people at high risk of acquiring HIV.

It is indicated in all HIV negative persons at high risk of HIV.

Before initiation, individuals must be screened for HIV using the national HTS algorithm and rule out signs of Acute HIV infection as for oral PrEP. 

- Administration: Its administrated in the buttock once every 8 weeks 
- Side effects: The injectable cabotegravir is safe and welltolerated. 

- Efficacy/Effectiveness: The injectable cabotegravir was found to be over 95% effective 273
- Safety: No safety concerns have been associated - Acceptability and barriers: In a study setting it was highly acceptable 
- Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to active substance

## Note:

 For detailed guidance on the provision of CAB-LA, please refer to the Technical Guidance on Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for Persons at High Risk of HIV in Uganda, 2022.

## 3.1.12 **Psychosocial Support For Hiv-Positive Persons**

HIV-positive persons benefit greatly from the following support after the first impact of the test result is overcome:
~ Provide of emotional support
~ Help the person understand the social, medical, and psychological implications for him/herself, the unborn child (in the case of a pregnant woman), and any sexual partners
~ Connect the person with support services, including (religious) support groups, orphan care, income- generating activities, home care and others
~ Help the person find strategies to involve his/her partner and extended family in sharing responsibility
~ Help the person identify someone from the community to support and care for him/her
~ Discuss with HIV positive mothers how to provide for the other children in the family
~ Help him/her identify a person from the extended family or community who will provide support
~ As appropriate, confirm and support information given in HIV counselling and testing on mother-to-child transmission, possibility of ARV treatment, safer sex, infant feeding and FP advice
~ Help the person to understand and develop strategies to apply new information within daily life.

# 3.2 Sexually Transmitted Infections (Sti)

STIs are a collection of disorders, several of which are better regarded as syndromes for more effective management using a syndromic approach.

## Prevention Of Stis

~ General preventive measures include:
~ Give health education about STIs ~ Provide specific education on the need for early reporting and compliance with treatment
~ Ensure notification and treatment of sexual partners
~ Counsel patient on risk reduction e.g. practice of safe sex by using condoms, remaining faithful to one sexual partner, personal hygiene
~ Provide condoms
~ If necessary and possible, schedule return visits

## 3.2.1 **Urethral Discharge Syndrome (Male)** Icd10 Code: R36

It refers to urethral discharge in men with or without dysuria, caused by a number of diseases usually spread by sexual intercourse, which produce similar manifestations in males and may be difficult to distinguish clinically.

## Causes

~ Common: Neisseria gonorrhoea (causing gonorrhoea),
~ Chlamydia trachomatis and Ureaplasma urealyticum
~ Uncommon: Trichomonas vaginalis
 

~ Mucus or pus at the tip of the penis; staining underwear ~ Burning pain on passing urine (dysuria), frequent urition Investigations Pus swab: Gram stain, culture and sensitivity Blood: Screen for syphilis and HIV
 Examine patient carefully to confirm discharge

## 3.2.2 **Abnormal Vaginal Discharge Syndrome** Icd10 Code: N76

Often the first evidence of genital infection al, though absence of abnormal vaginal discharge does not mean absence of infection. Normal discharge is small in quantity and white to colourless. 

Not all vaginal infections are sexually transmitted diseases.

## Causes

~ Can be a variety and often mixture of organisms
~ Vaginitis: by Candida albicanis, Trichomonas vaginalis or bacterial vaginosis (by Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis)
~ Cervicitis: commonly due to gonorrhoea and chlamydia: 
usually asymptomatic and rarely a cause of abnormal vaginal discharge.

~ Clinical features ~ Increased quantity of discharge, abnormal colour and odour
~ Lower abdominal pain, itching and pain at sexual intercourse may be present
~ In Candida albicans vaginitis: very itchy thick or lumpy white discharge, red inflamed vulva
~ Trichomonas vaginalis: itchy greenish-yellow frothy discharge with offensive smell
~ Bacterial vaginosis: thin discharge with a fishy smell from the vagina Candida vaginitis and bacterial vaginosis are NOT sexually transmitted diseases, even though sexual activity is a risk factor.

~ Gonorrhoea causes cervicitis and rarely vaginitis. Thereis a purulent thin mucoid slightly yellow pus discharge with no smell and non-itchy
~ Chlamydia causes cervicitis which may present with a nonitchy, thin, colourless discharge

## Differential Diagnosis

~ Cancer of the cervix (blood-stained smelly discharge)
~ Intra-vaginal use of detergents, chemicals, physical agents and herbs, chronic tampon use, allergic vaginitis

## Investigations

 Speculum examination Pus swab: microscopy, Gram stain, C&S
 PH, KOH Blood: syphilis tests (RPR/VDRL)
 HIV Testing

## 3.2.5 Inguinal Swelling (Bubo) Icd 10 Code: A57

 
It is an STI syndrome presenting as localised swellings or enlarged lymph glands in the groin and femoral area.

Causes
~ Chlamydia strains: lymphogranuloma venerium (LGV)
~ Heamophilus ducreyi: chancroid
~ Treponema pallidum: syphilis

~ Excessively swollen inguinal glands
~ Pain, tenderness ~ Swellings may become fluctuant if pus forms

## Differential Diagnosis

~ Other causes of swollen inguinal lymph nodes, e.g. leg ulcer
~ Obstructed inguinal hernia Investigations As for Genital Ulcers C&S of pus
 
Patient complains of inguinal swelling Take history and examine for genital ulcers, rule out infection of the foot, leg or buttock and exclude inguinal hernia If genital ulcer is present Inguinal/femoral buboes present and no ulcer Treat as genital ulcer Give Doxycycline 100 mg 12 hourly for 14 days. 

Treat partner. If partner pregnant, instead of Doxycycline give Erythromycin 500 mg every 6 hours for 14 days. Do not incise bubo. Aspirate through normal skin with a large bore needle gauge <20 every 2 days until resolution.

If buboes persist, check to see if partner was treated. If partner not treated Continue with Doxycycline 100 mg 12 hourly for 14 days or Erythromycin 500 mg every 6 hours for 14 days.

If no improvement Refer for specialist's management

~ Treponema pallidum: causes syphilitic warts (condylomata lata)
~ Molluscum contagiosum virus
 

~ Penis, foreskin, labia and vagina are the most common sites of the warts
~ Warts can be variable in number and size, either few or multiple, small to very large
~ HPV warts: soft fleshy growth on genitals ~ Syphilitic warts: flat-topped and broad based growth ~ Molluscum contagiosum: light coloured, umbilicated growths on the face and genital areas Differential diagnosis

## 3.2.7 Syphilis Icd10 Code: A51-53

Complex chronic bacterial infection affecting a variety of organs and with multiple manifestations.

## Cause

~ Treponema pallidum
~ Transmitted sexually and from mother to foetus, rarely through blood transfusion or non sexual contact

The disease has several stages
~ Primary syphilis: 10-90 days following inoculation, characterized by a painless genital ulcer with clean base and indurated margins, regional lymphadenopathy. It can heal spontaneously but the disease will progress to secondary lesions
~ Secondary syphilis: few weeks to months (max 6 months) 
from primary lesions, characterised by:
 Generalised maculopapular rash Mucous membranes lesions (patches and ulcers)
 Weeping papules (condyloma alata) in moist skin areas Generalized non tender lymphadenopathy Fever, meningitis, hepatitis, osteitis, arthritis, iritis
~ Early latent syphilis (<1 year in duration): clinically quiescent but possible relapse of secondary syphilis
~ Late latent syphilis: clinically quiescent, not very infectious 
(but possible maternal foetal transmission)
~ Late (tertiary) syphilis: at any time after secondary syphilis 
(even many years):
- nfiltrative tumour of skin, bones, liver - Aortitis, aneurysms, aortic regurgitation - Central nervous system disorders (neurosyphilis): meningo vascular syphilis, hemiparesis, seizures, progressive degeneration with paraesthesias, shooting pains, dementia, psychosis Investigations Non-treponemal antibody tests (VDRL and RPR)
- Positive 4-6 weeks after infection - Used as screening test - Possibility of false positive - Remains positive 6-12 months after treatment Treponemal antibody tests (TPHA): very sensitive, used to confirm a positive non-treponemal test. Remains positive for long even after treatment so its positivity may not indicate active disease.

## 3.2.9 Congenital Sti Syndromes

Congenital STIs in newborns occur as a result of infection of babies in utero or during delivery as a complication of untreated STIs among mothers. Syphilis, HIV, gonococcal, chlamydia and herpes simplex are the most serious congenital STIs.

## 3.2.9.1 **Neonatal Conjunctivitis (Ophthalmia Neonatorum)** Icd10 Code: P39.1

Refers to conjunctival infection of neonates by STI organisms in the infected mother's birth canal. It is a very serious condition that can lead to corneal ulceration and ultimately to blindness. Blindness in children is associated with high infant morbidity and mortality.

## Causes

~ Commonly caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae and
~ Chlamydia trachomatis
~ Other non-STI causes of neonatal conjunctivitis predisposed by difficult labour such as early rupture of membranes, vacuum extraction or other assisted vaginal delivery

~ Purulent discharge from one or both eyes within 30 days from birth
~ Inflamed and swollen eyelids
~ Complications of untreated conjuctivitis: corneal ulceration, perforation, scarring and blindness

## 3.2.9.2 **Congenital Syphilis** Icd10 Code: A50

It is a serious debilitating and disfiguring condition that can be fatal. About one third of syphilis infected mothers have adverse pregnancy outcome, one third give birth to a healthy baby, while the remaining third may result into congenital syphilis infection.

Cause
~ Treponema pallidum bacteria

~ May be asymptomatic ~ Early congenital syphilis: begins to show after 6-8 weeks of delivery
- Snuffle, palmar/plantar bullae, hepatosplenomegaly, pallor, joint swelling with or without paralysis and cutaneous lesions. These signs are non-specific.

~ Late congenital syphilis: begins to show at 2 years
- Microcephaly, depressed nasal bridge, arched palate, perforated nasal septum, failure to thrive, mental sub normality and musculoskeletal abnormalities

It is classified into 3 types:
 Sub-acute endocarditis: caused by low virulence organisms such as Streptococcus viridans Acute endocarditis: caused by common pyogenic organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus Post-operative endocarditis: following cardiac surgery and prosthetic heart valve placement. The most common organism involved is Staphylococcus aureus

 Disease may present as acute or chronic depending on the microorganism involved and patient's condition Fatigue, weight loss Low grade fever and chills or acute severe septicaemia Embolic phenomena affecting various body organs (e.g. brain)
 Heart failure, prominent and changing heart murmurs Splenomegaly, hepatomegaly Anaemia Splinter haemorrhages (nail bed and retina) Finger clubbing Diagnostic triad: persistent fever, emboli, changing murmur

 Rheumatic heart disease, congenital heart disease Prosthetic valve Invasive dental/diagnostic/surgical procedures (including cardiac catheterization)
 Immunosuppression IV drug use/abuse Note: Any unexplained fever in a patient with a heart valve problem should be regarded as endocarditis

 Cardiac failure with heart murmurs Febrile conditions associated with anaemia

## Investigations

 Blood cultures: These are usually positive and all efforts should be made to identify the responsible pathogen and obtain sensitivity data At least 3 sets of blood cultures (8 ml) each should be obtained 
(each from a separate venipucture) at least one hour apart Blood: Complete blood count, ESR Urinalysis for microscopic haematuria, proteinuria Echocardiography ECG

## 4.1.5 Atrial Fibrillation Icd10 Code: I48

Common cardiac arrhythmia characterised by irregular pulse due to the loss of the regular atrial electrical activity. Its onset can be acute or chronic, and it can be symptomatic or asymptomatic.

 

 Heart disease (heart failure, valvular heart diseases, ischaemic heart disease)
 Thyroid disease (hyperthyroidism)
Clinical features Irregular pulse (frequency and volume), heart rate can be either normal or very high Acute onset (often with high heart rate): palpitations, dizziness, fainting, chest pain, shortness of breath Chronic (with normal or almost normal heart rate): often asymptomatic, discovered at routine checks It can precipitate heart failure or pulmonary oedema It can cause embolic stroke if clots form in the heart and are then dislodged to the brain circulation

## Investigations

## 4.1.11 Stroke Icd10 Code: I63

A cerebral neurological dysfunction due to a problem in blood circulation: a clot (ischaemic stroke) or bleeding (haemorrhagic stroke).

Causes
~ Clot (a thrombus in a brain vessel or an embolus from a clot sowhere else) - most common

5Respiratory Diseases

## 5.1 Non-Infectious Respiratory Diseases 5.1.1 **Asthma** Icd10 Code: J45

A chronic inflammatory disease of the airways which leads to muscle spasm, mucus plugging and oedema. It results in recurrent wheezing, cough, breathlessness and chest tightness. Acute attacks may be precipitated by upper respiratory tract infections (e.g., flu) and exposure to irritant substances (e.g. dust, exercise, and cold).

Causes
~ Not known but associated with allergies, inherited and environmental factors

~ No fever (if fever present, refer to pneumonia)
~ Difficulty in breathing (usually recurrent attacks) with chest tightness, with or without use of accessory muscles. Patients may not appear very distressed despite a severe attack
~ Wheezing, rhonchi
~ Cough - usually dry, may be intermittent, persistent, or acute, especially at night Severe forms: failure to complete sentences, darkening of lips, oral mucosa and extremities (cyanosis)
Differential diagnosis
~ Heart failure
~ Other causes of chronic cough ~ Bronchiolitis
~ Bronchiectasis Investigations Diagnosis is mainly by clinical features Specialised investigations Peak flow rate: the peak flow rate increases to about 200 ml following administration of a bronchodilator Spirometry (an increase in Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV) of 
>12% after bronchodilation)
 Sputum: for eosinophilia If evidence of bacterial infection Chest X-ray Blood: complete blood count General principles of management The four essential components of Asthma Management: Patient education, control of asthma triggers, monitoring for changes in symptoms or lung function, and pharmacologic therapy.

~ Inhalation route is always preferred as it delivers the medicines directly to the airways; the dose required is smaller, the side-effects are reduced E.g., nebuliser solutions for acute severe asthma are given over 5-10 minutes, usually driven by oxygen in hospital In children having acute attacks, use spacers to administer inhaler puffs
~ Oral route may be used if inhalation is not possible but systemic side-effects occur more frequently, onset of action is slower and dose required is higher
~ Parenteral route is used only in very severe cases when nebulisation is not adequate.

## 5.1.1.1 **Acute Asthma**

Asthma attack is a substantial worsening of asthma symptoms. The severity and duration of attacks are variable and unpredictable. Most attacks are triggered by viral infections. Assess severity using the following table:
Not all features may be present. If the patient says they feel very unwell, listen to them!

## 5.1.1.2 **Chronic Asthma**

General principles of management
~ Follow a stepped approach Before initiating a new drug, check that diagnosis is correct, compliance and inhaler technique are correct and eliminate trigger factors for acute exacerbations
~ Start at the step most appropriate to initial severity
~ Rescue course Give a 3-5 days "rescue course" of prednisolone at any step and at any time as required to control acute exacerbations of asthma at a dose of:
Child < 1 year: 1-2 mg/kg daily; 1-5 years: up to 20 mg daily; 5-15 years: Up to 40 mg daily; adult: 40-60 mg daily for up to 3-5 days.

~ Stepping down Review treatment every 3-6 months If control is achieved, stepwise reduction may be possible If treatment started recently at Step 4 (or contained corticosteroid tablets, see below), reduction may take place after a short interval; in other patients 1-3 months or longer of stability may be needed before stepwise reduction can be done

## Prevention

~ Avoid precipitating factors e.g.

 Cigarette smoking Acetylsalicylic acid Known allergens such as dust, pollens, animal skins Exposure to cold air
~ Exercise can precipitate asthma in children, advise them to keep an inhaler handy during sports and play
~ Effectively treat respiratory infections

## 5.1.2 **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (Copd)** Icd10 Code: J42-44

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease characterized by chronic obstruction of lung airflow that interferes with normal breathing and is not fully reversible.

- The more familiar terms 'chronic bronchitis' and 'emphysema' are no longer used, but are now included within the COPD diagnosis.

- Such a diagnosis should be considered in any patient who - has symptoms of cough, sputum production, or dyspnea 
(difficult or labored breathing), and/or a history of exposure to risk factors for the disease.

A COPD exacerbation is an acute worsening of the patient's respiratory symptoms needing a change in medications.

Causes and predisposing factors
~ Tobacco smoking is the commonest cause
~ Indoor air pollution: Biomass fuel smoke (firewood, charcoal and cow dung) exposure in poorly ventilated kitchens
~ Exposure to occupational dust and chemicals (cement, paint, saw dust, fumes) without adequate protection
~ It may frequently follow TB disease (residual symptoms)

~ Chronic cough in a current or previous smoker who is over 40 years
~ Breathlessness: persistent, progressive and worse with exercise +/- tight chest and wheezing
~ Chronic sputum (mucuos) production and 'bronchitis' for at least 3 months in 2 successive years
~ On examination, there may be a barrel chest (increased antero-posterior diameter)
~ Rapid breathing, reduced chest expansion, with or without increased use of accessory muscles of respiration, rhonchi, cyanosis
~ Decreased breath sounds, ankle swelling and other signs of right heart failure

## Differential Diagnosis ~ Asthma

~ Congestive heart failure
~ Pulmonary embolism
~ Pulmonary TB

## Investigation

 Spirometry: gold standard for diagnosis but if not available use all available tools (history of exposure to risk factors + clinical symptoms + any available investigations).

 History of exposure to risk factors Chest X-ray (Hyper-inflated lungs) Peak flometry Echocardiography - when one suspects right-sided heart failure secondary to COPD
Management
~ Treatment aims at:
 Removing risk factors and preventing further damage Relief of symptoms and prevention of the severity and frequency of COPD exacerbations Improving the patients exercise tolerance and maintaining
~ good health
~ Inhalers are the preferred formulation for the treatment of COPD.

~ Often starts with rhinopharyngitis, descend progressively to larynx, pharynx, tracheitis
~ Irritating, productive cough sometimes with scanty mucoid, blood streaked sputum
~ Chest tightness, sometimes with wheezing
~ Fever may be present ~ No tachypnoea or dyspnoea ~ Secondary bacterial infection: fever > 38.5°C, dyspnoea, purulent expectorations 345
 
Differential diagnosis

Note

TREATMENT LOC

 Avoid cough syrups in children below 6 years Prevention
~ Avoid contact with infected persons
~ Include adequate fresh fruits and vegetables in the diet 5.2.4 Acute Epiglottitis **ICD10 CODE: J05.1**
An acute inflammation of the epiglottis, a rare but serious disease of young children. Airway obstruction is always severe, and intubation or tracheostomy is often needed. It is rare since routine childhood mmunization with Hib vaccine was introduced.

## Cause

~ Bacterial infection, commonly Haemophilus influenzae

~ Rapid onset of high fever
~ Typical: "tripod or sniffing" position, preferring to sit, leaning forward with an open mouth, appears anxious
~ Sore throat, difficulty swallowing, drooling, respiratory distress
~ Stridor and maybe cough
~ Appears critically ill (weak, grunting, crying, drowsy, does not smile, anxious gaze, pallor, cyanosis)
~ Asphyxia leading to quick death

## Differential Diagnosis

~ Laryngeal cause of stridor e.g., laryngotracheobronchitis

## Caution

 Avoid tongue depression examination as this may cause complete airway blockage and sudden death Do not force child to lie down as it may precipitate airway obstruction 348

## 5.2.9 Pneumonia Icd10 Code: J13-18

Acute infection and inflammation of the lungs alveoli. There are two major types:
~ Bronchopneumonia: involves both the lung parenchyma and the bronchi. Common in children and the elderly
~ Lobar pneumonia: involves one or more lobes of the lung. 

Common in young people

## Causes

Causative agents can be viral, bacterial or parasitic. Pathogens vary according to age, patient's condition and whether infection was acquired in the community or hospital (Gram negative are more common in hospital).

~ Neonates: group B streptococcus, Klebsiella, E.coli, Chlamydia and S. aureus
~ Children <5 years: Pneumococcus, Haemophilus influenzae, less frequently: S. aureus, M. catarrhalis, M. Pneumoniae, viruses (RSV, influenza, measles)

## Investigations

If facilities are available Do a chest X-ray and look for complications, e.g.

- Pneumothorax, pyothorax
- Pneumonitis suggestive of pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia 
(PCP)
- Pneumatocoeles (cavities filled with air) suggestive of staphylococcal pneumonia Sputum: For Gram stain, Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain, culture for AFB
 Blood: Complete blood count

## 5.2.9.1 **Pneumonia In An Infant (Up To 2 Months)**

In infants, not all respiratory distress is due to infection. But as pneumonia may be rapidly fatal in this age group, suspected cases should be treated promptly and referred for parenteral treatment with antimicrobials. Consider all children < 2 months with pneumonia as SEVERE disease.

Clinical features
~ Rapid breathing ( 60 breaths/minute)

| ~   | Severe chest in drawing, grunting respiration     |
|-----|---------------------------------------------------|
| ~   | Inability to breastfeed                           |

5.2.9.5 **Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia** 
Refer to section 3.1.10.2

# 5.2.9.6 **Lung Abscess** Icd10 Code: J85.0-1

Localised inflammation and necrosis (destruction) of lung tissue leading to pus formation. It is most commonly caused by aspiration of oral secretions by patients who have impaired consciousness.

Cause
~ Infection of lungs with pus forming organisms: e.g.

~ Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus Clinical features
~ Onset is acute or gradual
~ Malaise, loss of appetite, sweating with chills and fever ~ Cough with purulent sputum, foul-smelling breath (halitosis)
~ Chest pain indicates pleurisy
~ Finger clubbing Complications
~ Pus in the pleural cavity (empyema)
~ Coughing out blood (haemoptysis)
~ Septic emboli to various parts of the body, e.g. brain (causing brain abscess)
~ Bronchiectasis (pus in the bronchi)
Differential diagnosis
~ Bronchogenic carcinoma
~ Bronchiectasis
~ Primary empyema communicating with a bronchus ~ TB of the lungs
~ Liver abscess communicating into the lung Investigations Chest X-ray Early stages: Signs of consolidation Later stages: A cavity with a fluid level Sputum: For microscopy and culture and sensitivity

## 5.3 Tuberculosis (Tb) Icd11 Code: A15-A19

5.3.1Definition, Clinical Features and Diagnosis of TB
A chronic infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. It commonly affects lungs but can affect any organ (lymph nodes, bones, meninges, abdomen, kidney).

 
For more information on the management of TB see:
 Manual of the National TB/Leprosy Programme (NTLP) in Uganda 4th Edition, 2022 NTLP desk guide Latent TB guidelines National drug resistant TB guidelines Causes
~ Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (e.g. M. tuberculosis,
~ M. bovis, M. avium, M. africanum and M. Microti)
~ M. tuberculosis is the commonest cause of tuberculosis 
~ Transmission by droplet inhalation (cough from a patient with open pulmonary TB); can also be through drinking unpasteurised milk, especially M.bovis

General symptoms
~ Fevers especially in the evening, ~ excessive night sweats
~ Weight loss and loss of appetite

## Pulmonary Tb

~ Chronic cough of >2 weeks (however, in HIV settings, cough of any duration)
~ Chest pain, purulent sputum occasionally blood-stained, shortness of breath

## Extrapulmonary Tb

~ Lymphnode TB: Localized enlargement of lymph nodes depending on the site affected (commonly neck)
~ Pleural or pericardial effusion
~ Abdominal TB: ascites and abdominal pain
~ TB meningitis: subacute meningitis (headache, alteration of consciousness)
~ Bone or joint TB: swelling and deformity Complications
~ Massive haemoptysis - coughing up >250 mL blood per episode
~ Spontaneous pneumothorax and pleural effusion
~ TB pericarditis, TB meningitis, TB peritonitis ~ Bone TB: can be TB spine with gibbus, TB joints with deformity)
~ Respiratory failure

Differential diagnosis
~ Histoplasma pneumonia, trypanosomiasis, brucellosis
~ Pneumonia
~ COVID-19
~ HIV/AIDS ~ Malignancy
~ COPD, asthma, bronchiectasis, emphysema etc.

~ Post TB lung disease
~ Fungal infection of the lungs e.g. Aspergillosis Screening and diagnosis of TB disease TB screening: is defined as the systematic identification of people at risk for TB disease, in a predetermined target group, by assessing using tests, examinations or other procedures that can be applied rapidly TB screening approaches: 
- Symptom screening or CXR
- All individuals seeking health care should be screened for TB at each visit Investigations for TB
 Obtain sputum sample or other relevant samples from presumptive TB patients for diagnosis 
- Xpert MTB/RIF is the recommended diagnostic test for TB diagnosis 
- Where Xpert MTB/RIF test is not available, do Sputum smear microscopy for AAFBs (ZN stain) but send the sample for Xpert MTB/RIF test.

GeneXpert MTB/Rif: automated DNA test on body samples (sputum, lymphonodes tissue, pleural fluid, CSF etc) which can diagnose pulmonary TB and determine susceptibility to Rifampicin. It is superior to microscopy.

Other investigations X- ray, abdominal ultrasound, biopsies etc. can be used for sputum and GeneXpert negative patients or in case of extrapulmonary TB according to clinical judgement TST can be used as a supportive test to guide decision to treat for TB in children
 **putum culture and Drug susceptibility test:** is a confirmatory test for TB and also provides resistance pattern to TB medicines. Do this test for:
 Patients with Rifampicin resistance reported with GeneXpert Also patients on first-line treatment who remain positive at 2 months and are reported Rifampicin sensitive on GeneXpert Patients suspected to be failing on first-line treatment Note: All presumed and diagnosed TB patients should be offered an HIV test

## 5.3.1.1Tuberculosis In Children And Adolescents

TB may present at any age in children though the risk is highest below the age of two years. When compared to adults, children are more prone to TB infection, TB disease, and severe forms of TB disease.

Risk factors
~ Contact with infectious (pulmonary) case of TB
~ Age < 5 years
~ Immunosuppression (HIV, malnutrition, diabetes, etc).

~ Age < 1 year and lack of BCG vaccination are risk factors for severe disease

~ Suspect TB in all children with
- Fever > 2 weeks - Cough >2 weeks - Poor weight gain for one month - Close (home) contact of pulmonary TB case. - In young children, reduced playfulness, poor feeding, decreased activity
- Other signs include swollen lymph nodes in the neck, groin region etc.

Investigations Bacteriological confirmation of TB is more difficult in children. 

The diagnosis of TB in children is dependent on conducting a detailed clinical assessment combined with available tests Whenever possible, geneXpert should be performed Management The principles and objectives of TB treatment are similar to those of adults. In addition, effective treatment of TB in children promotes growth and development.

## 5.3.1.2 Drug-Resistant Tb

Drug resistance is said to occur when TB organisms continue to grow in the presence of one or more anti-TB medicines.

~ Although several factors can contribute to the development of drug-resistant TB, inadequate anti-TB treatment is probably the most important. Inadequate anti-TB treatment leads to mutation in drug-susceptibility bacilli making them drug resistant.

Who is at risk for drug-resistant TB:
 
 Contact with known drug-resistant tuberculosis Retreatments (relapses, treatment after failures, return after loss to follow-up)
 History of frequent interruption of drug treatment Patients who remain sputum smear-positive at month 2 or 3 of first-line anti-TB treatment
~ Patients presumed to have DR-TB should be screened using rapid drug susceptibility testing (DST) of rifampicin (Xpert MTB/RIF, Truenat)
 All patients who are drug-resistant TB suspects should therefore have sputum/other specimens taken for culture and DST.

~ Patients with drug-resistant TB should be linked to desi nated MDR TB treatment initiation centers in the respective regions DRUG RESISTANT TB IS A MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM. INADEQUATE TB TREATMENT IS THE MAJOR CONTRIBUTING FACTOR

## 5.3.1.3 Post-Tb Patient Management

A post-TB patient is one who was successfully treated for TB but presents with respiratory symptoms (chest pain, shortness of breath, cough).

~ Re-do standard TB diagnostic evaluation (sputum geneXpert and Chest X ray)
~ If negative, evaluate for post-TB lung disease e.g., bronchiectasias, COPD, pulmonary hypertension.

~ In most cases these patients have residual lung damage on Chest X-ray from previous TB, BUT they do not need retreatment if bacteriologically negative
~ Counsel the patient and give supportive treatment e.g., 
Pulmonary rehabilitation, etc.

## 5.3.2 Management Of Tb General Principles

~ The country has adopted patient centered care. It is recommended that all TB medicines are taken under direct observation by a treatment supporter (DOT). Digital Adherence Technologies (DAT) have been introduced to support treatment adherence.

~ Anti-TB drugs are given in fixed dose combination (FDC) 
regimens according to the patient's TB classification
- Treatment is divided into two phases: an initial (intensive) 
phase of 2 months and a continuation phase of 4 months (longer in severe forms of TB particularly TB meningitis and osteoarticular TB)TB treatment regimens are expressed in a standard format, e.g. 2RHZE/4RH where:
- Letters represent abbreviated drug names - Numbers show the duration in months - shows the division between treatment phases
~ Other shorter term (4-months) treatment regimen recently adopted 
- 2 HRE(Z)/2RH for children 2 months to 16 years
- 2 HPMZ/2HPM for adults 
~ Anti-TB drugs have side effects and they should be managed appropriately (see section 5.3.2.1)
~ TB treatment monitoring should be done by clinical, sputum and where possible radiological
~ A conclusion of "treatment outcome" status should be done for every patient treated for TB.

## Note

 Rifampicin interacts with oestrogen-containing contraceptives and reduces the protective efficacy of the contraceptives. Use high dose contraceptive or use an additional barrier method.

Important: The choice of regimen now depends on rifampicin sensitivity and not on the previous history of treatment:
 All patients without rifampicin resistance (either new or re-treatments) are treated with 1st line regimen.

 Patients with rifampicin resistance (either new or re- treatments) 
are treated with second line medication in a designated MDR-TB treatment facility.

Susceptible TB: 1st line treatment regimens For patients without rifampicin resistance to Gene Xpert MTB/Rif (both new and re-treatment cases). New cases not belonging to priority (risk) groups and in which diagnosis was done by sputum examination will also be treated with this regimen.

## Laboratory Monitoring (For Pulmonary Tb)

At the end of the initial 2 months:
- Sputum smear-negative; start continuation phase - Sputum smear-positive; do GeneXpert to rule out rifampicin resistance, start continuation phase and Xpert MTB/XDR where accessible, to rule out resistance to other drugs
- If Rifampicin-resistant, refer for MDR-TB treatment and
- If Rifampicin-sensitive, continue with first-line
- treatment, explore adherence issues but repeat smear at At the beginning of 5 months:

![51_image_0.png](51_image_0.png)

- Sputum smear-negative, continue with continuation treatment
- Sputum smear-positive, diagnose Treatment Failure - Take sputum for GeneXpert to rule out Rifampicin Resistance and Xpert MTB/XDR where accessible, to rule out resistance to other drugs
- If Rifampicin Resistant, refer for DR treatment - If INH resistant manage as INH mono-resistant TB as above
- If TB detected but not Rifampicin Resistant, restart first line regimen but explore adherence issues

## Monitoring Of Susceptible Tb

During the 6th month:
- Sputum smear-negative, complete treatment and declare cured or treatment completed
- Sputum smear-positive, diagnose treatment failure - Take sputum for GeneXpert to rule out rifampicin resistance and Xpert MTB/XDR where accessible, to rule out resistance to other drugs
- If Rifampicin-resistant, refer for MDR-TB treatment - If Rifampicin-sensitive, restart first-line treatment, explore adherence issues

| Clinical Monitoring (For All Tb Cases) - Monitor wellbeing and weight gain - Assess and reinforce treatment adherence - Assess and manage side effects   |

Hypersensitivity reaction Most anti-TB drugs can cause hypersensitisation between week 3 and week 8 of treatment in order of frequency: ethambutol, pyrazinamide, rifampicin and isoniazid. If mild (simple itchy rash), give antihistamine (e.g. chlorpheniramine) and moisturizer and continue treatment. Severe reactions are characterised by
- Fever, headache, vomiting - Macular dark erythematous rash which can progress to a Steven Johnson-Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis syndrome

## 5.3.2.2 **Prevention And Infection Control Of Tb**

Case diagnosis and management A TB patient is more infectious before they start TB treatment. 

~ Provide PPE to sputum-positive patients
~ Early detection of cases and initiation of appropriate TB 
treatment
~ Treatment under directly observed treatment (DOT) and follow up to ensure adherence and cure Contact tracing
~ Tracing of contacts of TB patients
~ Routine screening of health workers for latent & active TB
High Priority Patients For Contact Tracing
~ Bacteriologically confirmed PTB (Smear positive or Xpert positive or Culture positive) 
~ Cavitation of chest x-ray ~ Age < 5 years 
~ MDR TB - PLHIV
Other preventive measures
~ BCG vaccination at birth to prevent severe forms of TB
~ TB Preventive Treatment for categories at risk General hygiene
~ Avoidance of overcrowding
~ Avoid drinking unboiled milk
 
~ Cough hygiene (cover cough with pieces of cloth, washing hands with soap, proper disposal of sputum)
~ Good nutrition
~ Promote good ventilation in housing & transport 
- Open ventilators, windows & doors that allow air exchange 

## 5.3.2.3 **Tuberculosis Preventive Treatment**

Tuberculosis preventive treatment is recommended to prevent the development of active TB disease in an individual who has latent TB infection (LTBI). Uganda guidelines for programmatic management of Latent TB infection recommend TB preventive treatment (TPT ) in the following categories of people: 
- Persons living with HIV - Child & adult contacts of pulmonary TB patients

6.1 GASTROINTESTINAL EMERGENCIES
6.1.1 Appendicitis (Acute) ICD10 CODE: K35-K37 Inflammation of the appendix.

Causes
~ Blockage of the appendix duct with stool or particles, followed by infection by intestinal bacteria Clinical features
~ Constipation (common)
~ Pain situated around the umbilicus
- Crampy, keeps on increasing in severity
~ After some hours, the pain is localised in the right iliac fossa and becomes continuous
~ There may be nausea and vomiting
~ Fever (low grade in initial stages)
~ Tenderness and rigidity (guarding) in right iliac fossa
~ Generalized abdominal pain and signs of peritonitis follows rupture when the contents are poured into the abdominal cavity Differential diagnosis
~ Salpingitis (in females), ovarian cyst
~ Ectopic pregnancy CHAPTER 6: **Gastrointestinal and Hepatic Diseases**
~ Pyelonephritis, ureteritis (inflammation of the ureter)
~ Intestinal obstruction Investigations No special investigations - good history and physical examination are essential for diagnosis Complete blood count: look for leucocytosis Transabdominal ultrasound Abdominal X ray (to assess for perforation and intestinal occlusion)

## 6.1.3 Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding Icd10 Code: K92.2

Bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract (oesophagus, stomach and duodenum). It can be a medical emergency.

Cause
~ Gastro-oesophageal varices
~ Peptic ulcer disease/severe gastritis/cancer ~ Mallory Weiss tear (a tear in the oesophageal mucosa caused by forceful retching)

~ Vomiting of fresh blood (haematemesis) ~ Coffee brown emesis (degraded blood mixed with stomach content)
~ Melena: passing of soft dark red smelly stool ~ Black stools (in case of minor bleeding)

## Complications

~ Acute hypovolaemia (if acute and abundant): syncope, hypotension, tachycardia, sweating
~ Chronic anaemia (if subacute/chronic loss)
Diagnosis Endoscopy CHAPTER 6: **Gastrointestinal and Hepatic Diseases**
Irritation (inflammation) of the peritoneum Causes Infection following:
~ Perforation of the gut and leakage of its contents, e.g. burst appendix, perforated peptic ulcer
~ Perforated bowel due to obstruction or injury
~ Perforation of gall bladder, containing infected bile
~ Perforation of the uterus ~ Tuberculosis, abscess, typhoid ulcers ~ Malignancy
~ Post-operative peritonitis Chemical causes
~ Leakage of urine, blood, bile or stomach or pancreas content into the peritoneal cavity Clinical features
~ Severe and continuous pain Generalised if the whole peritoneum is affected
~ Abdominal swelling (distension)
~ Fever, vomiting, tachycardia, hypoxia
~ Hypovolemic shock, reduced urinary volume
~ Tenderr rigid abdomen
~ Rebound tenderness - pressure on the abdomen and sudden release causes sharper pain
~ Absent bowel sounds investigations
~ Abdominal X-ray and/or ultrasound CHAPTER 6: **Gastrointestinal and Hepatic Diseases**
~ Blood: Complete blood cell count, culture and sensitivity
~ Renal function and electrolytes
~ Liver function tests

## 6.5 Hepatic And Biliary Diseases 6.5.1 Viral Hepatitis

A condition characterised by inflammation of the liver due to hepatitis viruses. They may cause acute hepatitis, symptomatic or not. The hepatitis B, D, C virus can cause chronic hepatitis. The hepatitis B virus can also give chronic carrier status.

Cause
~ Hepatitis A and E: orofaecal transmission
~ Hepatitis B: sexual, mother to child, transmission by infected body fluids /blood
~ Hepatitis C virus: contact with infectious blood (possibly sexual and vertical)
~ Hepatitis D: contact with infectious blood, sexual (possibly vertical)

## 6.5.1.1 Acute Hepatitis **Icd10 Codes: B15, B16, B17, B19** Clinical Features

~ Asymptomatic
~ Classic form: fever, fatigue, malaise, abdominal discomfort 
(right upper quadrant), nausea, diarrhoea, anorexia, followed by jaundice, dark urine and more or less clay coloured stool
~ Fulminant form: acute liver failure due to massive liver necrosis, often fatal. It is more common in HepB patients with secondary infection with D virus and pregnant women who get hepatitis E in their third trimester CHAPTER 6: **Gastrointestinal and Hepatic Diseases**

## Differential Diagnosis

~ Other causes of hepatitis, e.g. drugs, herbs, tumours, and autoimmune diseases
~ Gastroenteritis, relapsing fever ~ Pancreatitis
~ Malaria, leptospirosis, yellow fever
~ Haemorhagic fevers, e.g. Marburg and Ebola

## Health Education

~ Mangement is lifelong because of the need to monitor hepatitis
~ Bed rest
~ Urge patient to avoid alcohol as it worsens disease ~ Immunisation of household contacts
~ Do not share items that the patient puts in mouth (e.g. 

toothbrushes, cutlery) and razor blades

## 6.5.2.1 **Inactive Hepatitis B Carriers** Icd10 Code: B18.1

Carriers are patients with chronic but inactive infection:
- HBsAg positive for more than 6 months plus - Persistently normal liver function (at least 3 times in 12 months) and
- No evidence of viral replication (negative HBeAg and/or - HBV DNA < 2000 IU/ml)
Patients classified as inactive carriers need to be monitored once a year with CBC, renal and liver tests, HBsAg, abdominal ultrasound. If possible, do HBV-DNA every 3 years. They are not highly infectious but close contacts should be immunized and appropriate precautions should be followed.

## 6.5.2.2 **Pregnant Mother Hbsag Positive** Icd10 Code: B18.1

If a pregnant mother is found HBsAg positive:
~ If also HIV positive,
- Start ARVs. - Child should receive HepB vaccine at birth
~ If she is HIV negative,
- She should be referred for further testing (HBeAg, HBV 
DNA) to assess the risk of transmission to the baby and eventual need of antiretrovirals
- Child should be immunized at birth
~ Breastfeeding is safe 6.5.3 **Chronic Hepatitis C Infection** ICD10 CODE: B18.2

## 6.5.4 **Liver Cirrhosis** Cicd10 Codes: K74, K70.3

Cirrhosis is a chronic disease with necrosis of liver cells followed by fibrosis and nodule formation. Decompensated cirrhosis is defined by the presence of complications such as ascites, variceal bleeding, encephalopathy, or jaundice which result from the portal hypertension and liver insufficiency caused by cirrhosis.

~ Infections e.g. viral hepatitis B and D, hepatitis C
~ Intoxication with alcohol, drugs, or toxins e.g. methotrexate, isoniazid, methyldopa
~ Infiltrative disorders, e.g. non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, Wilson's disease, haemochromatosis
~ Iron overload (e.g. in over transfused SCD patients)
~ Immunological, chronic autoimmune hepatitis ~ Congestion with bile e.g. primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC)
~ Congestion with blood e.g. chronic cardiac failure, Budd Chiari syndrome

## ~ Idiopathic Clinical Features

~ General symptoms: Fatigue, weight loss, features of malnutrition, nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite
~ Initially enlarged liver which later decreases in size
~ Distension of blood vessels on the abdomen ~ Enlarged spleen ~ Loss of libido ~ Cirrhosis is decompensated when the following are present: ~ Jaundice
~ Encephalopathy
~ Ascites (fluid in abdominal cavity) with or without leg oedema ~ Vomiting of blood from ruptured blood vessels in oesophagus (varices)

Best used if pedal oedema is present;  monitor for hypotension ‰ For maintenance, it is best to titrate to the lowest  diuretic dose. Most patients do well with spironolactone 50 mg/day if they have no ascites Drainage ‰ Indicated for severe ascites (Grade 3). Paracentesis  is always followed by spironolactone How much should you tap? - Small volume (less than 5 L in 3–4 hours)  or large volume (5–10 L) with infusion of a  plasma expander (e.g. 8 g albumin per litre of  ascites removed) - Monitor for hypotension or reduced urine  output ‰ Refer if patient has or develops complicated ascites             |       |

6.5.4.2 **Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP)** 

## Icd10 Code: K65.2

SBP is an acute bacterial infection of ascitic fluid. It is a common and severe complication of advanced liver cirrhosis and it is associated with a poor prognosis.

Patients must be admitted to hospital and should be suspected of SBP infection when:
~ Ascites increases in severity ~ Presence of fever
~ Abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness
~ Worsening encephalopathy
~ Complications: renal failure, bleeding varices, death

 Diagnosis is confirmed by an ascitic tap and cell counts. A neutrophil count of > 250/mm3 in ascitic fluid confirms the diagnosis Management

## 6.5.6 **Drug-Induced Liver Injury** Icd10 Code: K71

Drugs are an important and common cause of liver injury. Many medicines and herbs are known to cause liver damage. The drug-induced liver injury can range from asymptomatic elevation of liver enzymes to severe hepatic failure. Health workers must be vigilant in identifying drug-related liver injury because early detection can decrease the severity of hepatotoxicity if the drug is discontinued. Knowledge of the commonly implicated agents is essential in diagnosis.

## Common Causes

~ Phenytoin, carbamazepine, anti-tuberculosis drugs, cotrimoxazole, diclofenac, paracetamol, antiretroviral drugs, ketoconazole Clinical features It is a diagnosis of exclusion:
~ Any patient with liver enzyme elevation that cannot be attributed to infections, autoimmune disease or malignancy
~ Patient exposed to a drug or herbal medication known to cause liver cell injury
~ Patients may present with skin or mucosal drug reactions
~ e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolsis

## 6.5.7 **Jaundice (Hyperbilirubinemia)** Icd10 Code: R17

Yellowish discoloration of sclera and skin due to raised levels of bilirubin in the body. Bilirubin is a by-product of red cell breakdown, processed in the liver and excreted mainly in bile. Jaundice may be benign or life threatening.

~ Pre hepatic - haemolysis e.g sepsis, sickle cell disease, pregnancy (HELLP syndrome), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), vascular
~ Hepatic - hepatitis, drugs, tumors, alcohol, toxins, herbs, autoimmune disease, pregnancy, cholangitis
~ Post hepatic - gall stones, strictures, tumors, surgery, pancreatitis, biliary disease Complications
~ Renal failure , coagulopathy
~ Sepsis CHAPTER 6: **Gastrointestinal and Hepatic Diseases**
~ **Investigations**
~ Liver function tests (AST, ALT, bilirubin), Coomb's tests, low haptoglobin, LDH
~ Hepatitis A, B, C ~ Malaria, sickle cell screen ~ Ultrasound shows dilated bile ducts and gall bladder
~ CBC, INR, RFTS, LDH, Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram (ERCP)
~ Liver biopsy

## 7.1.2 **Chronic Kidney Disease (Ckd)** Icd10 Code: N18

Chronic impairment of kidney function

## Causes/Risk Factors

~ Diabetes mellitus
~ Hypertension/cardiovascular disease
~ Age >50 years
~ Kidney stones ~ Drugs especially pain killers like diclofenac, ibuprofen and other NSAIDs
~ Family history of kidney disease
~ HIV/AIDS

~ Most patients with CKD have no symptoms until the disease is advanced
~ May present with features of predisposing risk factor
~ Anaemia, lethargy, easy fatigue, appetite loss, nausea, vomiting, skin itching, bone pains
~ May have body swelling
~ May have loin pain Differential diagnosis
~ Other causes of chronic anaemia ~ Heart failure ~ Protein-energy malnutrition ~ Chronic liver disease Investigations Creatinine/Urea/electrolytes Urine dip stick for protein and blood Kidney ultrasound How to screen for CKD in patient at risk Urine dipsticks (for protein and blood) and blood pressure measurement at least once a year in high risk patients In diabetics, urine microalbumin where possible or a spot urine for protein: creatinine ratio at least once a year Patients with detected abnormalities should have a serum creatinine test performed and GFR calculated as suggested above Refer the following patients for specialist attention:
~ Children ~ Persistent proteinuria or haematuria beyond 3 months
~ GFR <60 ml/min or creatinine >1.9 mg/dl
~ Familial kidney disease, e.g. polycystic kidney disease

## Management

Treatment of end stage renal disease is complex and expensive, and available only at national referral hospital Goals
~ Establish diagnosis and treat reversible diseases
~ Identify co-morbid conditions and manage further complications of CKD
~ Slow progression of CKD by optimizing treatment
~ Plan renal replacement therapy well before end stage kidney disease is reached

Caution Start ACE inhibitors at low doses and monitor renal function

~ Screening of high risk patients
~ Optimal treatment of risk factors
~ Treatments to slow progression in initial phases
~ Avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs

## 7.1.3 **Use Of Drugs In Renal Failure**

~ Be very careful when prescribing any medicine and check available prescribing information (e.g. in Practical Guidelines for Dispensing 2015) regarding use in renal failure/
impairment
~ Many medicines are excreted through the kidneys and acc mulate when urinary output is reduced
~ Some drugs are presented as sodium or potassium salts and contribute to accumulation of these electrolytes
~ With life-threatening infections (e.g. meningitis), use normal or high doses of antibiotics initially, and then reduce doses once the condition has responded Drugs which are usually safe fDoxycycline Erythromycin Benzylpenicillin (max 6 g daily in severe impairment)
 Phenytoin Rifampicin

## Drugs To Use With Care In Reduced Doses

ACE inhibitors (e.g. captopril)
 Amoxicillin Chloramphenicol (avoid in severe impairment) Ciprofloxacin r Cotrimoxazole r Diazepam Digoxin Insulin Isoniazid-containing medicines Pethidine (increase dose interval, avoid in severe impairment) Phenobarbital Propranolol

## Drugs To Avoid Using

 Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) and other NSAIDS e.g. ibuprofen, indomethacin Codeine Ethambutol Gentamicin Metformin Nalidixic acid Nitrofurantoin Streptomycin Tenofovir (TDF)

## 7.1.4 Glomerulonephritis Icd10 Code: N00-N01

Acute inflammation of the renal glomeruli (small blood vessels in the kidney)

~ Immune reactions often following an infection - usually 1-5 weeks after a streptococcal skin or throat infection

~ Common in children >3 years and adolescents
~ Haematuria (red, or tea-coloured urine)
~ Oedema: Puffiness of the face/around the eyes, less commonly generalised body swelling
~ Discomfort in the kidney area (abdominal or back pain)
~ Anorexia
~ General weakness (malaise)
~ High blood pressure for age, commonly presenting as headaches, visual disturbances, vomiting, and occasionally pulmonary oedema with dyspnoea
~ Convulsions (in hypertensive crisis)
~ Oliguria (passing little urine) as renal failure sets in
~ Evidence of primary streptococcal infection:
 Usually as acute tonsillitis with cervical adenitis Less often as skin sepsis

~ Kidney infections e.g. TB, pyelonephritis
~ Kidney tumours
~ Heart failure ~ Malnutrition
~ Allergic reactions Investigations Urine: Protein, microscopy for RBCs and casts, WBCs Blood: Urea (uraemia) and creatinine levels, ASOT, electrolytes Ultrasound: Kidneys Management Inflammatory kidney disease with oedema, hypertension and oliguria should be referred to regional hospital for specialised management.453

## 7.2 Urological Diseases 7.2.1 Acute Cystitis Icd10 Code: N30

An infection/inflammation involving the bladder, a part of the lower urinary tract. It is a common manifestation of uncomplicated UTI (Urinary Tract Infection) in non- pregnant women.

Uncomplicated cystitis is less common in men and needs to be differentiated from prostatitis and urethritis (sexually transmitted).

~ Bacterial infection, usually gram negative (from intestinal flora) e.g. Escherichia coli

~ Dysuria (pain and difficulty in passing urine)
~ Urgency of passing urine, frequent passing of small amounts of urine
~ Suprapubic pain and tenderness
~ Pyuria/haematuria (pus/blood in the urine makingit cloudy)
~ Foul smelling urine ~ There may be retention of urine in severe infection

 Midstream urine: urine analysis for protein, blood, leucocytes, nitrates, sediment Culture and sensitivity (if resistant/repeated infections)
Diagnostic criteria Symptoms ± leucocytes and/ or nitrates at urine analysis Differential diagnosis
~ Women: vaginitis
~ Men: urethritis (in young sexually active patients), prostatitis (fever, chills, malaise, perineal pain, confusion, in older men)
Note: Asymptomatic bacteriuria or pyuria (leucocytes in urine) does not need treatment except in risk groups such as pregnant women, patients undergoing urological interventions and post kidney transplant patients

 For urinary tract infection in pregnancy, see section 16.2.6 Prevention
~ Improved personal/genital hygiene ~ Pass urine after coitus ~ Drink plenty of fluids

## 7.2.2 **Acute Pyelonephritis** Icd10 Code: N10

Upper urinary tract infection involving one or both kidneys (but not usually involving the glomeruli)

~ Bacterial infection, e.g. Escherichia coli, usually due to ascending infection (faecal-perineal-urethral progression of bacteria)
 

## Risk Factors

~ Bladder outlet obstruction
~ Malformations of urinary tract
~ Pregnancy
~ HIV, old age, diabetes

~ Loin pain, tenderness in one or both kidney areas (renal a gle)
~ Fever, rigors (generalised body tremors)
~ Vomiting
~ If associated cystitis: dysuria, urgency, frequency
~ Diarrhoea and convulsions (common in children)
~ In infants and elderly: may simply present as fever and poor feeding/disorientation without other signs

~ Appendicitis
~ Infection of the fallopian tubes (salpingitis) ~ Infection of the gall bladder (cholecystitis)
Investigations Urine: Microscopy for pus cells and organisms, C&S of midstream urine Specimen should reach the lab within 2 hours of collection or be refrigerated at 4°C for not >24 hours Blood: Full count, C&S, urea, electrolytes Ultrasound kidneys/prostate

## 8.1.3 **Diabetes Mellitus** Icd10 Code: E08-E13

Metabolic disease resulting from insulin insufficiency or ineffectiveness, due to decreased insulin secretion, or peripheral resistance to the action of insulin, or a combination of the two.

 Type 1: decreased insulin production due to autoimmune destruction of the pancreas. Usually starts at a young age Type 2: insulin resistance, usually combined with insufficient production of insulin as the disease progresses. Usually starts in adulthood Gestational Diabetes - any degree of glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy.

 Secondary diabetes: due to other identifiable causes, e.g.,
Cushing's syndrome, chronic pancreatitis, etc.

## Risk Factors

Type 1: genetic factors, environmental factors (e.g., some viral infections)
Type 2 Non-Modifiable risk factors: Age >40 years, Family history in first degree relatives, Gestational DM, delivery of big baby >4kg Modifiable risk factors; Unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, tobacco use, harmful use of alcohol, hypertension, stress, obesity, high cholesterol levels, impaired glucose tolerance

Classical symptoms o Polyuria - frequent urination, night waking to urinate o Polydipsia - frequent thirst, drink a lot of water o Polyphagia - increased appetite, feeling hungry all the time, frequent, eating o Polyneuropathy-burning pains, pins and needles, numbness Other symptoms o Weight loss despite high appetite o Frequent skin infections like boils, itchy genitalia (candidiasis), slow healing wounds o Fatigue - feeling tired all the time, children not wanting to play o Bed-wetting in children o Poor vision o May present with complications
~ Type 2 diabetes often only presents with minor aspecific symptoms, and it is diagnosed either by screening or when the patient presents with complications

## Complications

Acute complications of diabetes Acute coma due to diabetic ketoacidosis, or hyperosmolar hyperglycaemia (see section 8.1.4), or hypoglycaemia (see section 1.1.6)

## Chronic Complications

1.Microvascular complications: affect the small blood vessels, such as those supplying blood to the eyes and kidneys. The microvascular 
 
complications of diabetes are retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy.

2. Macrovasculary complications: affect the larger blood vessels, such as those supplying blood to the heart, brain and legs: stroke, heart attack, peripheral artery disease Stroke, ischaemic heart disease, kidney failure Blindness, impotence, peripheral neuropathy Diabetic foot which may lead to amputations

~ Diabetes insipidus, HIV/AIDS, TB
Investigations Blood glucose (fasting, random, and/or 2 hours after 75mg of glucose)
 Urine: for glucose, and ketones (in type 1) HbA1c - Glycated haemoglobin 1c Other baseline tests- RFTs, Lipid profile, ECG, urine protein or microalbuminuria

| 1   | Fasting blood sugar >7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dl)                                                          |

| 4   | In a patient with classical symptoms of hyperglycaemia:  Random Blood Sugar >11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dl) |

Diagnostic criteria Caution In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycaemia (very high levels of blood sugar), criteria 1-3 should be confirmed by repeated testing. One single slightly elevated blood sugar in the absence of symptoms IS NOT DIAGNOSTIC for diabetes General Management Goals of treatment Treatment of hyperglycaemia Treatment of associated risk factors Prevention and treatment of acute and chronic complications

## Prevention

- Educate patients on the use of iodised salt

## 8.1.8. Central Precocious Puberty

Also referred to as gonadotropin dependent precocious puberty is an endocrine- related developmental disease characterized by the onset of pubertal changes, with development of secondary sexual characteristics and accelerated growth and bone maturation, before the normal age of puberty (8 years in girls and 9 years in boys).

~ Premature activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal 
(HPG) axis. 

~ Idiopathic 
~ Secondary causes include brain tumors (glioma, astrocytoma), CNS infections (meningitism, encephalitis), brain malformations (hydroceohalus, arachnoid cysts), trauma and injuries.

~ Accelerated growth and bone maturation
~ Premature breast development
~ Early menarche in girls, and testicular and penile enlargement with development of facial and sexual hair in boys

## Genetic Counselling

~ Most cases are sporadic, familiar caese show autosomal dominant mode of transmission with incomplete, gender-dependent penetrance

~ Gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty ~ McCune-Albright syndrome
~ Gonadal tumours
~ Benign premature the larche Investigations Pelvic ultrasound Screening of basal luteinizing hormone (LH) levels or measurement of gonadotropin levels after stimulation tests using gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH)

## 9.1 Neurological Disorders 9.1.1 **Epilepsy** Icd10 Code: G40

~ A chronic condition characterised by recurrent unprovoked seizures. Seizures are caused by abnormal discharges in the brain and present in two different forms: convulsive and non-convulsive forms.

~ Convulsive epilepsy has features such as sudden muscle contraction, causing the person to fall and lie rigidly, followed by the muscles alternating between relaxation and rigidity with or without loss of bowel or bladder control
~ Non-convulsive epilepsy has features such as change in awareness, behaviour, emotions or senses (such as taste, smell, vision or hearing) similar to mental health conditions, so may be confused with them
~ Consider a diagnosis of epilepsy if a person has had at least 2 seizures in the last calendar year on two different days.

~ Seizures during an acute event (e.g. meningitis, acute traumatic brain injury) are not epilepsy.

Causes
~ Genetic, congenital malformation, birth asphyxia, brain tumour
~ Brain infections, cysticercosis, trauma (acute or in the past)
~ Metabolic disorders ~ In some cases, no specific causes can be identified.

 
Clinical features

~ Depending on the type of epilepsy:

Differential diagnosis Syncope (fainting), 
 Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) Hypocalcaemia (low blood calcium levels)
 Conversion disorder (previously known as hysteria) Hyperventilation (fast breathing) and Panic attacks Investigations A complete medical and mental health assessment Electroencephalogram (EEG)
- Useful in petit mal and focal seizures - To be done at specialist level (RR and NR)
 Other investigations are guided by suspected cause General principles
~ All suspected cases of non-convulsive epilepsy should be confirmed and treated by a specialist
~ Convulsive epilepsy can be diagnosed at hospital/HC3
~ level but drug refills should be available at lower levels
~ One brief isolated seizure does not need further treatment but review at 3 months and re-assessment. Treat patients with repeated episodes as per definition
~ Treatment can effectively control epilepsy in most cases
~ Treatment should include psychological and social support
~ Start with a single anti-epileptic medicine ~ Start with low doses and increase gradually according to response
~ If a patient has been seizure free for 2 years, consider gradual stopping of medication Commonly used antiepileptics include:
~ Generalized tonic-clonic seizures
•Children <2 years: phenobarbital or carbamazepine •Children >2 years: carbamazepine or valproate
~ Absence seizures: Valproate or ethosuximide
~ Caution: Avoid phenobarbital and phenytoin in children with intellectual disability and/or behavioural problems Management

The effective dose  must be reached progressively and patient monitored for  tolerance and side effects. Aim at the lowest dose able to  control (prevent) the seizures If treatment is ineffective (less than 50% reduction in crisis)  try another monotherapy (slowly reduce the current antiepileptic and introduce the new one) If high doses with side effects are required    |       |
| and seizures are anyway infrequent, less than complete control  can be the goal Follow up monthly until stable, then every 3 months Warn patient that treatment interruptions can trigger seizures  or even status epilepticus If no seizure for 2 years and no known cause like head trauma  or infection, consider possibility of stopping treatment (over  2 months). Discuss with the patient If 2 monotherapy trials fail, refer to specialist Carbamazepine |    | HC4   |

## 9.1.2 **Nodding Disease** Icd10 Code: G40.4

An unexplained neurologic condition characterized by episodes of repetitive dropping forward of the head, often accompanied by other seizure-like activity, such as convulsions or staring spells. The condition predominantly affects children aged 5–15 years and has been reported in South Sudan from the states of Western and Central Equatorial, northern Uganda and southern Tanzania.

Not yet certain but consistent association with onchocerciasis has been found Other associated factors: malnutrition, pyridoxine deficiency Clinical features
~ Starts at age 5-7 years in previously normal child
~ Early symptoms: problems in concentration and thinking
~ Then "nodding" starts, which is a type of seizure (atonic seizures) often triggered by eating or cold temperatures
~ Cognitive impairment appears
~ Neurological deterioration, delayed puberty and growth retardation progresses until the child becomes mentally and physically disabled Investigations No diagnostic investigations have been identified

## 9.1.3.1 Migraine Icd10 Code: G43

Periodic severe headache, usually unilateral, which may occur with or without an aura (neurological warning signs) and associated with nausea and/or vomiting

The cause is unknown but thought to be linked to:
~ Familial factors ~ Craniovascular disorders, which can be precipitated by: 
stress, anxiety, menstruation, flashing lights, hunger, lack of sleep, oestrogens (in COC), perfumes, tyramine- containing foods e.g. red wine, cheese, chocolate
~ Clinical features
~ Warning signs (aura): visual or sensory sympotms (flashing lights) preceeding the start of the headache
~ Migraine with warning signs is called migraine with aura. 

They are not always present
~ Moderate to severe episodic unilateral headache throbbing 
(pulsating)
~ Nausea and vomiting, sensitivity to light and sound Differential diagnosis
~ Any cause of headache

## 9.1.6 **Delirium (Acute Confusional State)** Icd10 Code: F05

A clinical syndrome usually with acute onset, which involves abnormalities in thought and perception and fluctuating level of consciousness. It is caused by impaired brain function resulting from diffuse physiological change.

~ Infections e.g. malaria, trypanosomiasis, syphilis, meningitis, rabies, typhoid fever, HIV/AIDS
~ Pneumonia and urinary tract infections in elderly
~ Intoxication with or withdrawal from alcohol or other substances of dependence
~ Some medicines e.g. anticonvulsants and neuropsychiatric medications
~ Cerebral pathology e.g. head trauma, tumour
~ Severe anaemia, dehydration
~ Electrolyte imbalances, hyperglycemia

~ Acute onset of mental confusion with associated disorientation, developing within hours or a few days. Attention, concentration and memory for recent events is impaired
~ Reduced ability to think coherently: reasoning and problem solving are difficult or impossible
~ Illusions and hallucinations are common
~ Symptoms tend to fluctuate: patients feel better in the day and worse at night
~ Some patients may present with reduced activity and/or movement (hypoactive delirium)
Differential diagnosis Acute psychosis Investigations
~ Guided by history and physical examination: aim at identifying the cause NB: drug history is very important!

~ CBC, blood glucose, RDT, renal function and electrolytes Management Due to the complexity of underlying conditions, patients with acute confusional state should be referred to hospital for appropriate management and investigation.

| Psychosocial interventions: counselling,  psychotherapy (individual and group psychotherapy) For an acute episode or intense prolonged anxiety  Benzodiazepines e.g. diazepam 5 mg 1-2 times daily - Increase if necessary to 15-30 mg daily in  divided doses Elderly: Alprazolam 0.25mg -0.5mg twice daily  initially, Increase if necessary to 3-6 mg daily in  divided doses. If alprazolam is not available, Give half the above dose  of diazepam - Duration of therapy 1-2 weeks, tapering off to  zero within 6 weeks If poor response: refer to specialist  Fluoxetine 20 mg once a day for long term  management of the anxiety disorder Or Sertraline 50mg once daily - Continue antidepressant for 4 to 6 weeks then  evaluate the response |               |

Caution Diazepam is addictive and abrupt cessation can cause withdrawal symptoms. Use for short periods and gradually reduce the dose. Avoid alcohol Notes Diazepam is NOT appropriate for treating depression, phobic or obsessional states, or chronic psychoses (see relevant sections 9.2.2 for more information)
 Antidepressants: May be useful in managing panic disorders and other anxiety disorders which require long term treatment

## 9.1.1 **Alcohol Use Disorders** Icd10 Code: F10

Conditions resulting from different patterns of alcohol consumption, including acute alcohol intoxication, harmful alcohol use, alcohol dependence syndrome and alcohol withdrawal state.

Causes
~ No single cause; a combination of factors usually leads to alcohol use disorders Risk / Predisposing factors
~ Genetic
~ Social and environmental factors including availability
~ Stress, peer pressure
~ Personality disorders Clinical features

## Acute Intoxication

~ Transient condition following intake of alcohol resulting in disturbances of consciousness, cognition, perception, affect or behaviour Harmful alcohol use
~ Pattern of alcohol consumption that is causing damage to the health, physical (e.g. liver disease) or mental (e.g. depressive disorder). 

~ And causing problems to one's social, occupational and other important areas of life. Criteria:
- More than five drinks in any given occasion in the last 12 months
- More than two drinks a day - Drinking every day
~ These patients consume more alcohol than 
~ Recommended but they do not fulfil (yet) the criteria for alcohol dependence Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is extremely harmful for the baby: it can cause foetal 

## Alcohol Dependence

~ A disorder characterised by the need to take large daily amounts of alcohol for adequate functioning. The use of alcohol takes on a much higher priority for the individual than other behaviours that once had greater value
~ Complications: malnutrition, thiamine deficiency (causing Wernicke encephalopathy), liver disease, chronic pancreatitis, peptic ulcer, cardiomyopathy, neuropathy, head trauma etc.

~ Alcohol withdrawal
~ Symptoms occurring upon cessation of alcohol after its prolonged daily use (6 hours to 6 days after)
~ Include 
~ Tremor in hands, sweating, vomiting, tachycardia, hypertension, agitation, anxiety, headache, seizure and confusion in severe cases

## Alcohol Dependence

~ A disorder characterised by the need to take large daily amounts of alcohol for adequate functioning. The use of alcohol takes on a much higher priority for the individual than other behaviours that once had greater value
~ Complications: malnutrition, thiamine deficiency (causing Wernicke encephalopathy), liver disease, chronic pancreatitis, peptic ulcer, cardiomyopathy, neuropathy, head trauma etc.

~ Alcohol withdrawal
~ Symptoms occurring upon cessation of alcohol after its prolonged daily use (6 hours to 6 days after)
~ Include 
~ Tremor in hands, sweating, vomiting, tachycardia, hypertension, agitation, anxiety, headache, seizure and confusion in severe cases Diagnostic criteria for alcohol dependence:
If 3 or more of the features below are present:
~ A strong desire to take alcohol
~ Difficulties controlling alcohol use in terms of onset, termination or levels of use
~ A physiological withdrawal state when alcohol use has ceased or been reduced (alcohol withdrawal syndrome)
~ Evidence of tolerance: increased doses of alcohol are required to achieve effects originally produced by lower doses
~ Progressive neglect of alternative pleasures or interests because of alcohol use
~ Alcohol use persists despite clear evidence of harmful consequences e.g. liver damage, depression, cognitive impairment, loss of a job, friends, relationships Differential diagnosis
~ Abuse of other psychoactive substances
~ Depression, chronic psychosis (often co-existing!)
Investigations Blood: complete blood count, liver enzymes
- Shows elevated MCV and GGT levels Social investigations

~ Amphetamines (e.g. speed)
~ Mandrax® (methaqualone) ~ Benzodiazepines
~ Barbiturates (phenabarbitone)

Presenting features that may point to drug use disorders
~ Change in behaviour e.g. excessive irritability
~ Change in function e.g. decline in school/work performance
~ Loss of interest ~ Episodes of intoxication e.g. slurred speech, staggering gait ~ Involvement in illegal activities e.g. rape, theft ~ Change in appearance e.g. weight loss, red eyes, puffy face, untidy, scars from multiple needle pricks
~ Financial difficulties e.g. stealing, unpaid debts
~ Relationship problems e.g. increased conflicts, communication breakdown
~ Find out if person uses illegal or prescribed drugs in a way that risks damage to their health Investigations Ask about use of illicit or non-prescribed drugs If yes, assess for features of dependence (3 or more of the following):
- A strong desire to take drugs - Difficulties controlling drug use in terms of onset, termination or levels of use
 
- A physiological withdrawal state when drug use has - ceased or been reduced (as shown by classic withdrawal symptoms)
- Evidence of tolerance: increased doses of the drug are required to achieve effects originally produced by lower doses
- Progressive neglect of alternative pleasures or interests because of drug use
- Drug use persists despite clear evidence of harmful - consequences e.g. depression, loss of a job Investigate concurrent physical or mental illnesses

## 9.1.3 Childhood Behavioural Disorders Icd10 Code: F90-F98

A general term including more specific disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and other behavioural disorders. Only children and adolescents with moderate to severe degree of psychological, social, educational or occupational impairment should be diagnosed as having behavioural disorders. In some children the problem persists into adulthood.

Investigate if the child's behavior is a reaction to trauma and/or fear (child is bullied or harmed at home or outside home). In this case, it is NOT a behavioral disorder; The bullying, and or Abuse must STOP'!

Causes
~ Genetic ~ Depression
~ Medical conditions, alcohol or drug use
~ Reaction to fear or trauma Clinical features
~ Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
~ Impaired attention (breaking off from tasks and leaving ac- tivities unfinished) so severe as to affect normal functioning and learning
~ Excessive restlessness, overactivity especially in situations requiring calm, talkativeness, fidgeting
~ Of early onset (<6 years) and lasting >6 months
~ Other behavioural disorders ~ Unusually frequent and severe tantrums, persistent severe disobedience
~ Repetitive and persistent pattern of dissocial, aggressive or defiant conduct (bullying, cruelty to animals, destructiveness, fire setting etc.), more severe than ordinary mischief, not only in response to severe family or social stressors, and lasting >six months Differential diagnosis Depression, psychosis Epilepsy, developmental disorders Medical conditions e.g. .hyperthyroidism

## 9.1.4 **Childhood Developmental Disorders Icd10 Code: F80-F89**

 
A broad spectrum of disorders with childhood onset, characterized by impairment or delay in functions related to central nervous system maturation, and with a steady course rather than remissions and relapses as in other mental illnesses. They include intellectual disability/mental retardation as well as pervasive developmental disorders such as autism.

Causes
~ May not be known
~ Nutritional deficiencies e.g. iodine deficiencies
~ Medical conditions ~ Alcohol use during pregnancy
~ Risk factors: maternal depression, infections in pregnancy Clinical features
~ Delay in development (using local developmental milestones or comparison with other children)
~ Intellectual disability
~ Impairment of skills across multiple development areas (i.e. 

cognitive, (thinking), language, motor and skills)
~ Lower intellingence and decreased ability to adapt to daily demands of life Pervasive developmental disorders including autism Impaired social behaviour, communication and language Oddities in communication (lack of social use of language skills, lack of flexibility of language used)
 Loss of previously acquired skills Narrow range of interests and activities that are both unique to the individual and carried out repetitively originating in infancy or early childhood
 
 Some degree of intellectual disability may be present Some children may be gifted in specific areas e,g Music, computer Investigations Look for other priority mental, neurological or substance use disorder (depression, epilepsy, behavioural disorder)
 Consider if delay in development could be due to non- stimulating environment or maternal depression Assess for nutritional and other medical conditions e.g. sensory impairments (blindness, deafness etc.)

# Musculoskeletal And **10Joint Diseases**

![0_Image_0.Png](0_Image_0.Png)

## 10.1 Infections

10.1.1 Pyogenic Arthritis (Septic Arthritis) ICD10 CODE: M00 Acute infection of a single joint (usually a large joint), commonly affecting children.

## Causes

~ Usually haematologenous spread from a primary focus following bacteraemia (e.g. septic skin lesions, sinus infections, throat infections, abrasions, wounds, pressure sores, and osteomyelitis)
~ Commonly involved in acute arthritis: Staphylococcus aureus and Gram negative bacilli, e.g., Salmonella spp, Streptococcus spp, Gonococcus
~ In chronic septic arthritis: Brucella, tuberculosis Clinical features
~ Swollen and warm joint
~ Severe pain, reduced or abolished movement, temporary loss of limb function (pseudoparalysis)
~ Localised heat and tenderness
~ Systemic symptoms: fever (neonates may not show fever but refuse to feed), general malaise
~ Complications: irreversible joint damage if immediate treatment is not established
 
Differential diagnosis
~ Inflammatory joint disease ~ Intra-articular haemorrhage, e.g., haemophilia and other bleeding disorders
~ Trauma ~ Osteomyelitis of neighbouring bone Investigations Blood: Full blood count, C&S, ESR (usually elevated) Joint fluid: Aspirate for C&S; in case of failure to get pus by aspiration, use arthrotomy (in theatre)
 Joint fluid: Gram stain Management

## 10.1.2 **Osteomyelitis** Icd10 Code: M86

Infection of bone by pus-forming bacteria, mainly affecting older children and adults.

Causes
~ Any type of bacterium but most commonly S.aureus,
~ following infection elsewhere in the body 554 
~ Risk factor: sickle cell disease (causative agent mostly S. 

Aureus, Salmonella also common)
Clinical features Acute osteomyelitis
~ Onset is usually over several days
~ Fever, usually high but may be absent, especially in neonates
~ Pain (usually severe)
~ Tenderness and increased "heat" at the site of infection, swelling of the surrounding tissues and joint
~ Reduced or complete loss of use of the affected limb ~ The patient is usually a child of four years or above with reduced immunity, but adults may also be affected
~ History of injury may be given, and may be misleading, especially if there is no fever

## Chronic Osteomyelitis

~ May present with pain, erythema, or swelling, sometimes in association with a draining sinus tract
~ Deep or extensive ulcers that fail to heal after several weeks of appropriate ulcer care (e.g. in diabetic foot), and non-healing fractures, should raise suspicion of chronic osteomyelitis

## Differential Diagnosis

~ Infection of joints
~ Injury (trauma) to a limb, fracture (children)
~ Bone cancer (osteosarcoma, around the knee) ~ Pyomyositis (bacterial infection of muscle)
~ Cellulitis
~ Sickle-cell disease (thrombotic crisis)
Investigations X-ray shows Nothing abnormal in first 1-2 weeks Loss of bone density (rarefaction) at about 2 weeks May show a thin "white" line on the surface of the infected part of the bone (periosteal reaction)
 Later, may show a piece of dead bone (sequestrum)
 Blood: CBC, ESR, C&S: Type of bacterium may be detected attempt ZN,gene expert, culture if lesion suspect Calcoflour stain for fungus Management Patients with suspected osteomyelitis need to be referred to hospital for appropriate management.

## 10.1.4 **Tuberculosis Of The Spine (Pott'S Disease)** Icd10 Code: A18.01

Tuberculous spondylitis (Pott's disease) is the most common form of skeletal TB; it usually affects the lower thoracic and upper lumbar region. Infection begins with inflammation of the intervertebral joints and can spread to involve the adjacent vertebral body. Once two adjacent vertebrae are involved, infection can involve the adjoining intervertebral disc space, leading to vertebral collapse. Subsequent kyphosis can lead to cord compression and paraplegia.

Causes
~ A chronic infection caused by Mycobacteria

## Clinical Features

~ Most common in young adults ~ Local pain, which increases in severity over weeks to months, sometimes in association with muscle spasm and rigidity
~ Constitutional symptoms such as fever and weight loss are present in < 40% of cases
~ With the progression and spreading of the disease, anterior collapse of affected vertebrae leads to visible deformity 
(angular kyphosis or gibbus), and risk of cord compression:
~ Weakness of legs (Pott's paraplegia)
- Visceral dysfunction
~ Differential diagnosis ~ Staphylococcal spondylitis ~ Brucellosis ~ Metastatic lesion Investigations Adequate history and careful examination X-ray spine: disc space narrowing, paravertebral shadow, single/
multiple vertebral involvement, destruction lesions of 2 or more vertebrae without new bone formation, destruction of vertebral end-plates Blood: raised ESR, WBC (within normal limits)

## 10.2 Inflammatory/Degenerative Disorders 10.2.1 **Rheumatoid Arthritis** Icd10 Code: M05

Most common form of chronic inflammatory joint disease affecting mainly women. Attacks tend to be bilateral with symmetrical involvement that cause joint destruction.

Causes
~ Unknown origin, probably autoimmune Clinical features
~ Stiffness and pain in the joints (usually >3, symmetrical, worse in the morning)
~ Joints are swollen, warm, inflamed, and sensitive to touch
~ Fingers are most affected (metacarpophalangeal, or proximal interpahalangeal), but all small and medium size joints can be affected (rarely hips and spine)
~ Extra articular manifestations: mild fever, weakness, lethargy, anorexia, weight loss, rheumatoid nodules (20%) at extensor surface like forearm below joint
~ It is a CHRONIC disease with flare-up, remission, and exacerbations
~ In advanced cases, joint deformities may occur Differential diagnosis
~ Osteoarthritis, gout arthritis (in males) ~ Reactive arthritis Investigations Blood: Full blood count, ESR, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear factor X-ray of affected joints Management Goals of treatment
~ Relief of symptoms
~ Preservation of joint function
~ Suppression of active disease, and slowing progression of disease (prevention of structure damage and deformity)
~ Maintenance of patient's normal lifestyle Symptomatic treatment can be started at lower level but appropriate management requires referral for specialist care.

Reference range in newborns and infants Adapted from Medscape Sept 2016 "haemoglobin concentration"

Decreased production of red blood cells
~ Nutritional iron, and/or folic acid/vitamin B12 deficiency
~ Depressed bone marrow function (leukaemia, aplasia) ~ Infections (HIV, TB, visceral leishmaniasis)
Increased destruction of red blood cells (haemolysis)
~ Malaria
~ Drug side effects (dapsone, cotrimoxazole, AZT)
~ Congenital disorder, e.g. sickle cell anaemia, G6PD deficiecy

## Loss Of Red Blood Cells

~ Acute and chronic blood loss (e.g. haemorrhage after trauma, hookworm infestation, pregnancy, abortion, heavy menstrual loss, schistosomiasis, massive or chronic GI bleeding)

## Clinical Features (Commonly)

~ Pallor of conjuctivae, mucous membranes, palms, soles
~ Fatigue, dizziness, palpitations, headache, anorexia, sometimes weight loss, low exercise tolerance
~ Signs of heart failure if severe: oedema in lower limbs, dyspnoea, tachycardia, heart murmurs
~ If due to acute blood loss: postural hypotension, decreased cardiac out put, tachycardia, sweating, restlessness and thirst
~ Look for signs of specific pathology, e.g., splenomegaly, malaria, nutrition deficiency, haemolysis jaundice, etc.

Investigations Complete blood count (CBC) with differentials, Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV), platelets, and a peripheral smear, reticulocyte count Evaluate Hb levels according to the patient's age Classify anaemia according to MCV
 **Microcytic (smallRBCs):** measure serum ferritin to evaluate for iron deficiency, HB electrophoresis for thalassemias,sideroblastic anaemia may be caused by drugs like isoniazid and chloramphenicol, evaluate for chronic blood loss especially gastrointestinal bleeding through stool analysis for parasites, and occult blood.

~ **Macrocytic:** Do vitamin B12 and fasting serum folate levels to evaluate for vitaminB12 orfolate deficiency, do TSH to evaluate for thyroid disease, evaluate for chronic alcohol abuse and use of, drugs like zidovudine, methotrexate, hyroxyureaantifolate medications Normocytic: evaluate for acute blood loss loss, chronic diseases, renal failure. , Investigate for the cause of hemolysis using peripheral film for schistocytes suggestive of microangiopathic hemolytic anaemia, HB
Note Anaemia is not a final diagnosis: careful history, physical examination and laboratory tests are essential to determine the cause Management General principles Determine and treat the cause Consider need for blood transfusion according to:
 Level of haemoglobin Clinical condition (haemodynamic status of patient, presence of heart failure, ongoing blood loss)
11.1.1.1 Iron Deficiency Anaemia ICD10 CODE: D50 Anaemia due to iron deficiency

## Cause

~ Poor nutritional intake with iron-poor foods.

~ Chronic blood loss, e.g., infestation with hook worms, prolonged/excessive menstrual bleeding, chronic gastrointestinal bleeding (e.g., chronic use of NSAIDS, large bowel tumors, esophageal varices)

~ It usually develops slowly
~ As per general anaemia symptoms plus:
 Sore tongue, atrophy of lingual papillae Erosions of the corners of the mouth Brittle, fragile fingernails Differential diagnosis
~ Conditions that cause microcytic red cells Investigations Blood: CBC, Hb, (haematocrit (Hct) rarely <28% unless iron de- ficiency is present)
 Low MCV and Mean Corpuscular Hb (MCH)- hypochromia.This may not be obvious in patients who have already been transfused Hypochromic microcytic (small size) red cells Investigate the cause of iron deficiency

## 11.1.1.2 Megaloblastic Anaemia Icd10 Code: D51-52

Anaemia characterised by large red blood cells. Usually due to folate and/or vitamin B12 deficiency. Some medicines (hydroxyurea, zidovudine, stavudine can cause macrocytic anaemia without folate and/or vitamin B12 deficiency).

Cause
~ Low dietary intake of folate/increased need (e.g., children, pregnancy)
~ Low dietary intake of vitamin B12 (in exclusively vegetarian diets, without any animal proteins)
~ Malabsorption of folate and vitamin B12 (severe gastritis, giardia infection, severe intestinal diseases)
~ Medicines e.g., metformin, zidovudine, hydroxyurea, stavudine, phenytoin
~ Other causes of macrocytosis: myelodysplasia, hypothyroidism, chronic alcohol use, multiple myeloma

~ General anaemia signs
~ Vitamin B12 deficiency: neuropsychiatric abnormalities e.g., hyperpigmented palms and feet, smooth beefy tongue, peripheral neuropathy, impaired vibration and position sense, abnormal gait, weakness, decreased muscle strength, spastic motions, memory loss, disorientation, depression, and acute confusional state

## Investigations

~ Blood smear: macrocytosis
~ Elevated MCH/MCV
~ Pancytopenia in severe cases ~ Full blood count: oval macrocytes, hypersegmentation of neutrophils, thrombocytopenia
~ Decreased serum Vitamin B12 or fasting red cell folate

## Note

![6_Image_3.Png](6_Image_3.Png)

 If vitamin B12 deficiency is suspected: (low leucocytes and platelets, neuropsychiatric symptoms, vegan diet) DO 
NOT GIVE folic acid alone but refer for further testing and treatment. Giving folic acid alone in patients with B12 deficiency may precipitate permanent neurological deficit.

 Anaemia normally corrects within 1-2 months. White cell count and thrombocytopenia normalise within 7-10 days DO NOT use ferrous-folate combination tablets to treat folic deficiency because the quantity of folic acid is too low

## 11.1.1.3 Normocytic Anaemia

![6_Image_5.Png](6_Image_5.Png)

Anaemia characterised by normal-sized red blood cells Cause
~ Acute blood loss

Prevention/Health Education for Anaemia Educate the public about:
~ The life long effects of anaemia on health, and cognitive development
~ Dietary measures: encourage exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months. Encourage the use of iron-containing weaning locally available foods (red meat, beans, peas, dark leafy vegetables)
~ Hygiene: avoid walking barefeet to avoid hook worm infestation, use of pit latrines for faecal disposal, and practice good hand washing habits
~ Medical: encourage periodic screening for children and pregnant mothers, and presumptive iron therapy for either groups in cases of anaemia (see IMCI and pregnancy guidelines, chapters 16 and 17)
~ Routine iron supplementation for all pregnant mothers
~ Early treatment of malaria, helminthic infections, etc.

## 11.1.2 Bleeding Disorders Icd10 Code: D65-D69

A bleeding disorder is suspected if a patient has unexplained bruising and bleeding (i.e. no history of trauma). Prolonged bleeding or oozing can also occur after injury or surgery (e.g., tooth extraction, small cut).

## Causes

~ Blood vessel defect Acquired: age, side effects of steroids, NSAIDS (e.g. easy bruising) Genetic e.g. hereditary telangiectasia
~ Platelet defect Decreased platelet number/function e.g., blood cancer, viruses, aplastic anaemia
~ Increased destruction e.g., in hypersplenism, autoimmune
~ disease, massive blood transfusion ~ Coagulation defect Hereditary e.g., haemophilia A or B, von Willebrand disease
~ Acquired e.g., warfarin or heparin, liver disease, alcoholism, acquired factor inhibitors for e.g. in malignancies, autoimmune diseases and pregnancy. y InfectiInfections: 
meningococcal sepsis, haemorrhagic fevers (causing widespread endothelial damage and disseminated intravascular coagulation)

~ Platelet disorder: mucosal bleeding (gingivitis, nose bleeds), 
superficial ecchymoses, excessive bleeding after minor injury, petechiae, heavy menstrual bleeding
~ Coagulation disorder: large, deep haematomas or haemathrosis

## Investigations

 Complete blood count, and platelet count (can be estimated using a peripheral smear if an auto-analyser is not available)
Bleeding time (time required for bleeding to stop). It is normal with coagulation factor deficiencies (except Von Willebrand disease), and abnormal in thrombocytopenia and qualitative platelet defects Coagulation tests Prothrombin time (PT): prolonged in factor VII, X, V, II 
deficiencies, liver disease, warfarin treatment International normalised ratio (INR) to monitor anticoagulation with warfarin (not useful for heparin and direct acting anticoagulants like rivaroxaban)
 Partial thromboplastin time (aPTT): prolonged in factor VIII, 
(hemophilia A) XII, XI, IX, (hemophilia B) X, V and I deficiencies If acute, consider if haemorrhagic fevers are the cause

## Management

Patients with acute bleeding disorders should be referred to hospital for appropriate investigations and treatment.

Patients with chronic bleeding disorders should be referred to a specialist.

## Treatment

~ Rivaroxiban tablets
~ 15mg once a day for 3 weeks then 20mg once a day for the duration of anticoagulation

~ Apixaban tablets for DVT/PE ~ 10mg once day for 7 days then 5mg twice a day
~ IVIG for ITP ~ 1g/kg intravenously, up to 3 doses on alternate days
~ ATG for aplastic anaemia
~ 10-20mg/kg intravenous infusion for up to 5-14 days then as required up to 21 doses

## Health Education

~ Advise the patient with chronic bleeding disorder to:
 Prevent injury Avoid injections and unnecessary surgery Visit the clinic immediately if symptoms occur Continue all medication as prescribed
~ All haemophiliacs should have prophylactic treatment be- fore traumatic procedures, e.g., tooth extractions, or sur- gery

## 11.1.3 Sickle Cell Disease Icd10: D57

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic haemoglobin disorder in which red blood cells which carry oxygen around the body change shape from a smooth doughnut shape into a crescent or half-moon shape. It is sometimes called Sickle Cell Anaemia (SCA).

## Cause

~ It is caused by a defect in beta chains where a given amino acid is replaced by another (Substitution of valine for glutamic acid) at position 6 of the chain. This change creates abnormal haemoglobin called HbS.

~ Symptoms usually appear from age of 3 to 6 months: 
anaemia, dactylitis (swelling of fingers), lobar pneumonia, recurrent severe bacterial infections. This results from the CHAPTER 11: **Blood Diseases and Blood Transfusion Guidelines**
reduction of the foetal haemoglobin F (HbF), and increase in HbS in the blood
~ Chronic anaemia: Hb 6–9 g/dl with episodes of acute worsening, which can be due to Aplastic crisis: sudden transient arrest of blood cells production in the bone marrow (low Hb and low reticulocyes), often due to ParvoB19 virus infection)
 Splenic sequestration: pooling of large amounts of red blood cells in the spleen with painful and rapidly enlarging spleen, decreasing haemoglobin with high reticulocyte count
~ Acute vaso-occlusive phenomenon (occlusion of blood vessels) causing:
 Painful crisis (acute, intense) at the back, chest, limbs, abdomen. In children <2 years, pain and swelling of hands and feet.

 Stroke: hemiplegia, altered consciousness, seizures Acute chest syndrome: fever, chest pain, difficulty in breathing, low oxygen level, cough, wheezing Acute abdomen or mesenteric crisis ("intestinal crisis"): abdominal pain and distension, reduced or absent bowel sounds, pallor, fever, Abdominal X-ray may show dilated bowel loops. Anaemia, high reticulocyte count, high CRPwill be present.

 Renal infarction, bone infarction and necrosis, especially at the head of femur, priapism
~ Chronic organ damage due to anaemia and vasocclusive phenomenon:
 Hyposplenia (spleen undergoes autosplenectomy due to multiple infarcts and is not functional anymore or has to be removed because of splenic sequestration)
 Pulmonary hypertension, asthma Chronic renal and hepatic disease, gallbladder stones Osteoporosis, retinopathy Chronic leg ulcers
~ Infections associated with asplenia and hyposplenism like pneumococcal infections Osteomyelitis, pneumonia, septicaemia

## Investigations

~ Family history of sickle cell disease
~ Full blood count & peripeharl film comment
~ Screening tests for sickling (not fully reliable) ~ Haemoglobin electrophoresis (confirms diagnosis)
~ Chest radiography (for Acute Chest Syndrome)
~ Abdominal ultrasound ~ Urinalysis
~ Liver and renal function tests
(nephropathy and acute kidney injury due to hypovolemia and hypoperfuson. >200cm/sec predicts high risk of having a stroke. This is less predictive in adults)

## Prevention/Health Education

~ Patient, family and community education
~ Timely initiation of hydroxyurea
~ Periodic comprehensive evaluations, and other diseasespecific health maintenance services
~ Periodic evaluation for sickle cell complications for example urinalysis and renal function for sickle cell nephropathy, cardiac echo for pulmonary hypertension, transcranial doppler in children for early detection of stroke risk. 

Patienst with these complications should be referred to a specialist 
~ Timely and appropriate treatment of painful crisis and acute illness 
~ Genetic counseling (for couples planning to have children)
~ Antenatalscreening 
~ Early recognition /screening of children with low Hb 
~ Vaccination (pneumococcal vaccine, H-influenza vaccine, HepatitisBvaccine evaluation) 
~ Antibiotic (oral penicillin twice a day ~ Timely and appropriate treatment of acute illness
~ Genetic counseling (for couples planning to have children)
~ Antenatal screening ~ Early recognition/screening of children with low Hb Vaccination (pneumococcal vaccine, H-influenza vaccine, Hepatitis B vaccine evaluation)
~ Antibiotic (oral penicillin twice a day in >5years), and antimalarial chemoprophylaxis

## 11.2 Blood And Blood Products

The Uganda Blood Transfusion Service (UBTS) collects blood and produces all blood products. Whole blood (WB): unseparated blood 

collected inanapprovedcontainerandcontainingapreservative or anticoagulant solution "Blood"referstoany blood component in which the main constituentisredbloodcells,e.g.,wholeblood(WB), red cell concentrate,orred cell suspension Unless otherwise specified, others are referred to as blood components or products. Blood components are preparedfrom WB, and contain negligible quantity of red cells,e.g., platelet concentrate, Fresh Frozen Plasma, Cryoprecipitate.(Referto the "National Blood Transfusion Guidelines for appropriate use of blood" formoredetails) UBTS ensures that all blood and blood products are producedinaway that ensures the health and safety of both patients and donors andminimisesthe risk oftransmitting infection through blood.

## 11.2.1 General Principles Of Good Clinical Practice In Transfusion Medicine

~ Blood is a scarce and expensive resource. Blood transfusion carries risks of adverse reactions and transfusion-transmitted infections
~ Use blood appropriately, that is, to treat conditions that can lead to significant morbidity or mortality, which cannot be prevented or effectively managed by other means
~ Minimise the need for transfusion by:
 Early diagnosis, and treatment of anaemia, in particular iron deficiency anaemia Stop blood loss, through good surgical and anaesthetic management Appropriate and timely management of coagulation disorders Use of simple alternatives to transfusion when appropriate, e.g., IV fluids as first line treatment of hypovolemic shock Prescribe transfusion according to patients individual needs, using clinical signs and symptoms, and expected outcome, but NOT only according to Hb level Do not use blood transfusion to:
 Expand blood volume, unless there has been blood loss of 
>30% of total volume Enhance wound healing "Top up" Hb prior to surgery Improve general well-being of the patient in patients with on-going fluid losses, e.g. surgical blood loss
~ Blood should not be transfused unless it has been:
 Obtained from appropriately selected donors (voluntary non-re- munerated donors)
 Screened for transfusion-transmissible infections (TTIs), namely; HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and syphilis Tested for compatibility (pre-transfusion) between the donor's red cells and the antibodies in the patient's plasma in accordance with national guidelines
~ The mandate to collect blood from donors, and screen it for TTI is reserved for UBTS
~ Guidelines and procedures for requesting, administering, and recording blood transfusion should be clearly spelled out, and strictly followed to avoid catastrophic mistakes (see below for)
~ Ensure the transfused patient is closely monitored (during and after transfusion) and that there is immediate response if any adverse reactions occur

## 11.2.2 Blood And Blood Products: Characteristics And Indications

The following section will present only whole blood and red cells concentrate. Availability and use of other blood components is reserved for referral hospitals and is beyond the scope of this guideline.

## 11.2.2.1 Whole Blood

~ Whole blood provides red blood cells, plasma volume, stable coagulation factors (VII, XI), and others
~ May not have enough functional platelets and labile coagulation factors (V and VIII)
~ It is also used as a raw material from which other blood components are prepared
~ 1 unit of whole blood is about 450 ml of donor blood; obtained from a single donation plus 63 mL of anticoagulant/preservative solution. It is available from HC4 level
~ Hct is approximately 35%
~ Each unit of blood will raise the HB by about 1g/dl

## Indications

~ Red blood cell replacement in acute blood loss (haemorrhage) with significant hypovolaemia such as in trauma, surgery, invasive procedures, GIT haemorrhage
~ Patients in need of red blood cell transfusion, where red cell concentrates or suspensions are not available (consider adding furosemide to avoid fluid overload)
~ Only Specialist Use: exchange transfusion in neonates, using less than 5-day old blood units

## Dose

 Adults: 1 unit at a time Children: 20mL/kg Caution
~ Transfusion must be started within 30 minutes of removal from the refrigerator, and completed within 4 hours of starting
~ Storage is 2-6°C in approved blood bank refrigerator with temperature charts and alarm
~ WB is contraindicated in severe chronic anaemia and incipient cardiac failure (risk of volume overload)
~ Blood should not be warmed (improvised warming method commonly used in health facilities is not necessary)
~ The routine use of diuretics (furosemide, or lasix), pre-transfusion is not necessary in most patients. Pre-transfusion diuretics are indicated in known cardiac and renal patients - to prevent circulatory overload.

## 11.2.2.2 Red Cell Concentrates (Packed Red Cells)

Red cell concentrates contain red blood cells, suspended in a small amount of plasma and additive solutions (which provides nutrients to the red cells in storage). It is in a form of two, or three pediatric bags, each containing 80-150 ml, obtained from a single donation. HCT is approximately 55%. It is available from HC4 level.

## Indications

~ Red blood cell replacement in anaemic patients
~ In acute blood loss, together with crystalloid solution if WB is not available

## Caution

~ Transfusion must be started within 30 minutes of removal from the refrigerator, and completed within 4 hours of starting
~ Storage is 2-6°C in approved blood bank refrigerator with temperature charts and alarm

## 11.2.2.3 Clinical Indications For Blood Transfusion

The indication for blood transfusion (with whole blood or red cell concentrates) depends on:
 The degree of anaemia (estimated by Hb level)
 The clinical conditions (high risk or presence of signs and symptoms of tissue hypoxia, or impaired tissue oxygenation resulting from anemia or blood loss)
Presence of ongoing blood loss (e.g., internal or external haemorrhage) 
Severe acute anaemia in children and infants Transfuse, if;
~ Hb ≤ 4 g/dL (or haematocrit ≤ 12%), whatever the clinical condition of the patient
~ Hb 4 - 6 g/dL (or haematocrit 13-18%), in case of life threatening complications, such as, clinical features of hypoxia and cardiac decompensation, acidosis (usually causes respiratory distress , impaired consciousness/coma, hyperparasitaemia (>20%) or cerebral malaria, septicaemia, meningitis Dose: Transfuse 10-15 mL/kg of packed red cells (or 20 mL/kg of whole blood) Note: In children with chronic anaemia caused by iron deficiency, it may be possible to correct with iron therapy alone.

## Severe Anaemia In Adults

~ Consider blood transfusion only in anaemia whose severity is likely to cause/ has already caused clinical signs of hypoxia, or impaired tissue oxygenation. These signs may include; tachycardia, shock, respiratory distress, weakness, dizziness and or unconsciousness.

 Transfuse 1 unit at a time, then re-assess If symptoms persist give another unit Transfuse in 2-4 hours CHAPTER 11: **Blood Diseases and Blood Transfusion Guidelines**
 Symptomatic anaemia (see above) in adults with <7 g/dL
 Haemoglobin <8g/dL if with cardiac disease or CNS symptoms
~ Give the minimum number of transfusions necessary to relieve hypoxia: 

## Severe Anaemia In Pregnancy

~ Generally, it is important to screen for iron deficiency anaemia early in pregnancy and treating with iron as necessary.

## Pregnancy <36 Weeks

~ Hb 5 g/dL irrespective of clinical condition
~ Hb 5-7 g/dL in case of established or incipient heart failure/impaired tissue oxygenation, pneumonia or other serious infection, malaria, pre- existing heart disease Pregnancy >36 weeks
~ Hb ≤ 6 g/dL
 Hb 6-8 g/dL in case of, established or incipient heart failure/impaired tissue oxygenation, pneumonia or other serious infection, malaria, pre-existing heart disease

## Elective Caesarean Section

If history of APH, PPH, previous caesarean section
~ Hb is 8-10 g/dL
 Establish/confirm blood group, and save freshly taken serum for cross-matching
~ Hb <8 g/dL
 Have 2 units of blood cross-matched and made available Pre-operative anaemia Pre-operative anaemia should be investigated, and promptly managed before surgery; Prompt management may include iron supplementation (oral, on intravenous)
 Where possible, surgery should be delayed or postponed, until anaemia is corrected, since pre-operative anemia is associated with poor surgical outcomes (morbidity and mortality), as well as an increased need for blood transfusion.

~ ≤ 8 g/dL in case of:
 Inadequate compensation for the anaemia (symptomatic anaemia)
 Significant co-existing cardiorespiratory disease Major surgery or significant blood loss expected Pre-surgical correction has not been possible Management of acute haemorrhage/hypovolemia
~ IV fluids (crystalloids: Normal saline) is the first line in treatment of hypovolaemia during acute haemorrhage
~ Whole blood (or red blood cells if WB unavailable) are indicated when blood loss is >20- 30% of blood volume (>15-20 mL/kg)
~ The need for blood must be determined by:
 Amount and speed of blood loss Patient's critical signs Initial response to IV fluid resuscitation
~ Hb level is NOT a reliable indicator for blood need in acute haemorrhage

## Sickle Cell Anaemia

~ Blood transfusion is not necessary for asymptomatic sickle cell patient with steady Hb 6-8 g/dL nor for an uncomplicated painful episode
~ In addition to general indications, blood transfusion is indicated if:
 Acute severe anaemia (Hb <5 g/dL or 2 g/dL lower than usual level for the patient) in aplastic and acute sequestration crisis. Aim at Hb 7-8 g/dL
 Hb <6 g/dL in uncomplicated pregnancy Hb <8 g/dL if caesarean section Hb <9 g/dL in case of acute chest syndrome (ACS), or stroke. For these four patient categories (pregnancy, C/section, ACS, and stroke), the target Hb is 11g/dL, and not any higher.

CHAPTER 11: **Blood Diseases and Blood Transfusion Guidelines**
 
~ Use packed cells if available (rather than WB)– whole blood is indicated Neonatal conditions
~ Severe anaemia (of any cause (prematurity, sepsis, etc.)
~ Transfusion in neonates should be managed at specialist level

## 11.2.3 Adverse Reactions Following Transfusion

Any potentially adverse sign or symptom resulting from a blood transfusion.

Common Acute Transfusion reactions (ATR)include; Minor allergic reaction (Urticaria)
 Febrile non-haemolytic transfusion reaction Acute haemolytic transfusion reaction (caused by ABO incompatibility): is a severe, and life threatening reaction Bacterial contamination Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) Severe allergic (Anaphylactic) reaction; relatively rare Delayed Transfusion reactions
~ Transfusion-transmitted infections, e.g., HIV, Hepatitis B, 
and Hepatitis C
~ Delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions General principles
~ Acute transfusion reactions (ATRs) may occur in 1-2% of transfused patients. 

CHAPTER 11: **Blood Diseases and Blood Transfusion Guidelines**
~ Rapid recognition and management of transfusion reactions may save the patient's life
~ Vital signs should always be taken (at a minimum) immediately prior to beginning the transfusion, 15 min after start and at end (see box with Key Points). In addition, a nurse or physician should observe the patient for the first 15 minutes after a new blood unit is started, and vital signs recorded
~ Errors and failure to follow correct procedures are the most common causes of life threatening acute haemolytic reactions. Such errors include; misidentification of patients - resulting in administering the wrong blood unit to the wrong patient, not repeating blood grouping of the blood units received at hospital, not cross-matching, and errors in labeling blood samples for pre-transfusion grouping and cross-match. These errors must be avoided.

~ ALWAYS store blood used for the compatibility testing for 7 days at 2-8°C for possible investigation on transfusion reactions
~ In a conscious patient with a severe acute haemolytic transfusion reaction, signs/symptoms may appear within minutes of infusing only 5-10 mL of blood In an unconscious or anaesthetised patient, hypotension, hypoxia and uncontrolled bleeding may be the only signs of a transfusion problem. As such, taking vitals regularly is important.

## Key Points

~ Accurate patient identification - at bed side, is critical during; Blood sample collection Administration of blood 
~ Monitoring transfusion is only way to identify ATRs
~ Monitoring transfusion is performed by taking vital signs; before, 15 minutes into, whenever a reaction is suspected, and at the end of transfusion CHAPTER 11: **Blood Diseases and Blood Transfusion Guidelines**

Vital signs taken;

If atransfusion reaction is suspected Stop the transfusion, and remove the giving set. Prior to disconnecting, the unit must be closed to avoid reflux of patient blood into the donor blood Check the blood pack labels and patient's identity. If there is a discrepancy, consult the blood bank Evaluate the patient; take vitals, and manage accordingly (See table below)
 Maintain intravenous access Obtain a post-transfusion blood sample. Return the implicated blood unit to the hospital blood bank. Re-grouping and testing are done on both patient and transfused samples Immediately report all suspected acute transfusion reactions to the hospital blood bank laboratory that works with the clinician For category two reactions, record the following in the patient's notes: type of reaction, time reaction occurred from start of transfusion, volume, type, and pack numbers of blood products transfused The type of reaction should be diagnosed, and a quick and clear investigation should be started in the hospital blood bank laboratory CHAPTER 11: **Blood Diseases and Blood Transfusion Guidelines**

## 12.1 Introduction

Cancer is an unregulated growth of a previously normal set of body cells. Oncology is the study, diagnosis, and management of cancers or tumours. It is important to note that any organ or system as well as any individual can be affected by cancer. This section will outline major symptoms and signs of cancer, key population groups affected, ways to mitigate risk of cancer and provide an overview of common cancers in adults and children. Cancer or malignant neoplasm is collective term for a group of more than 100 diseases that result from abnormal / uncontrolled growth of body cells and is able to invade normal tissues and spread to other parts of the body. The uncontrolled growth causes a lump/ swelling called a tumours or neoplasm in many types of cancer or an abnormal number of abnormal cells in some types of cancer such as blood cancers (Leukaemia). Tumours are broadly divided into benign tumors, meaning non-cancerous / unable to metastasize (spread to other parts of the body) or malignant tumors (able to invade normal tissues / spread to other parts of the body). Cancers are classified by their type of cell, tissue, or organ of origin. In Uganda, in 2020, it was estimated that there were 34,008 new cancer cases, 22,992 cancer deaths, and 62,548 adults living with cancer. The top five causes of cancer morbidity are cervix, Kaposi sarcoma (KS), breast, prostate, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The top five causes of cancer deaths are cancers of the cervix, KS, esophagus, liver, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In Uganda, children aged 0 - 14 years of age, constitute ten percent (10%) of cancer patients.

## 12.1.1 Special Groups At Increased Risk Of Cancer

~ HIV-positive patients
~ Albinos
~ Age group >65 years
~ Women (breast and cervical) ~ Smokers
~ Alcoholics
~ Consistent occupational exposure to toxins and/or radioactive material Note: Routine screening is recommended for these groups

## 12.1.2 Early Signs And Symptoms

Cancer should be investigated in an individual with the following symptoms having occurred for >2 weeks:
~ Sudden weight loss
~ Painless or painful swelling, lump, or thickening ~ Sores that fail to heal Hoarseness or cough
~ Abnormal bleeding or discharge
~ Persistent indigestion or difficulty in swallowing
~ Change in normal bowel or bladder habits
~ Chronic ulcers ~ Chronic pain
~ Change in a skin wart or mole

## 12.1.2.1 Urgent Signs And Symptoms

Common Signs and Symptoms of Cancer Health workers should inform clients / communities that don't wait for signs and symptoms of cancer. In most types of cancer, signs and symptoms manifest when the disease is advancing or in late stage. Each 
 
type of cancer manifest with unique signs and symptoms. However, many cancer patients report having experienced / noticed some symptoms or signs weeks/ months / years earlier before they felt very sick.

Cancer should be investigated in an individual with the following common signs and symptoms of cancer, especially when having occurred for >2 weeks:
 Sudden unexplained weight loss Painless or painful swelling, lump, or thickening Sores that fail to heal. Hoarseness or cough Abnormal bleeding or discharge Persistent indigestion or difficulty in swallowing Change in normal bowel or bladder habits Chronic ulcers Chronic pain Change in a skin wart or mole Urgent referral for a possible cancer malignancy might be necessary in patients with any of the following:

## 12.2 Prevention Of Cancer

Cancer prevention means activities or actions directed at avoiding, reducing, eliminating, or eradicating the risk of developing cancer or the impact of cancer on individuals and populations to promote health. Approximately 40% of cancers are preventable through interventions such as prevention of oncogenic infections (HPV, HIV, HBV, etc), alcohol, tobacco, and, environmental controls, promotion of healthy diets, and physical activity.

Prevention offers the most cost-effective long-term strategy for control of cancer.

Health workers are responsible for educating the public on:
~ Primary Prevention - sustained action to prevent a cancerous process from developing through risk factor reduction
~ Secondary Prevention - active discovery and control of cancerous or pre-cancerous lesions

## 12.2.1 Primary Preventionprimary

Prevention of cancer includes activities or actions directed at avoiding, reducing, eliminating, or eradicating the risk of developing cancer prior to the onset of cancer. 

Primary prevention gives control to the individual in maintaining a healthy lifestyle and environment to avoid or reduce cancer risk.

## 12.2.1.1 Control Of Risk Factors

Smoking/Tobacco Use Tobacco use increases the risk of several types of cancer, especially cancer of the lungs, oesophagus, larynx, mouth, throat, kidney, bladder, pancreas, stomach, and cervix Health workers must educate patients / clients / communities on the dangers of tobacco consumption and smoking; patients should be advised to avoid tobacco use. For patients /clients who smoke or use tobacco in any other form, health workers must encourage and support them to stop tobacco use.

## Unhealthy Diet

Consumption of unhealthy (unbalanced diet, sweetened food and beverages, charred, and unhygienic food) increases the risk of several types of cancer, especially cancer of the colon and rectum, mouth, pharynx, and larynx, corpus uteri, breast, kidney, liver, pancreas, esophagus, thyroid, prostate, multiple myeloma, and gallbladder. 

 Health workers must educate patients / clients / communities to:
 balance their diet with various types of healthy foods, eat plenty of healthy food such as whole grains, pulses, fruits, and vegetables, limit food high in sugar or fat and avoid sugary drinks, limit the amount of salt intake, limit eating red meat and avoid eating processed meat, avoid eating burnt or charred food.

## Overweight And Obesity

Being overweight or obese increases the risk of cancer, specifically the oesophageal, colorectal, breast, endometrial, and kidney cancers.

Heath workers must advise patients to maintain a healthy lifestyle, especially, regular physical activity and a healthy diet.

Also, inform them to maintain their body weight within the healthy range.

## Physical Inactivity

Sedentary lifestyle increases the risk of colon, endometrial, bladder, breast, lung, esophageal adenocarcinoma, renal, and gastric cancers. Heath workers must advise patients / clients to be physically active in everyday life. Limit the time you spend sitting and engage in at least 30 minutes of regularly physical activity per day or on most days of the week.

## Alcohol Use

Excess consumption of alcohol increases the risk of cancer of the oral cavity, oesophagus, larynx, liver, colorectal, and breast. Health workers should educate patients / clients/ communities of the dangers of excessive and regular alcohol consumption. The key messages should include: Not drinking alcohol is better for cancer prevention. If you drink alcohol of any type, limit your intake.

## Environmental Pollution

Regular exposure to carcinogenic chemicals in the environment can occur through unsafe drinking water, air pollution, and food contaminated by aflatoxin or dioxin chemicals, occupational exposure to dangerous gases or dusts.

Environmental carcinogens (aflatoxins, asbestos, vehicle emissions, lead, ultraviolet light, and ionizing radiation) will lead to increased risk of developing cancer, e.g. lung cancer Health workers must educate patients on environmental dangers and provide suggestions to limit exposure such as:
 Limiting indoor air pollution due to smoke from use of charcoal and firewood inside a poorly ventilated house Avoiding fumes from cars Avoiding exposure to garbage pollution (burning rubbish) Employers should provide employees with a safe working environment with limited occupational hazards

## Oncogenic Infections

The following infections are associated with causing certain types of cancer:
 Viral Hepatitis B/C: cancer of the liver Human Papilloma Virus (HPV): cervical, oral, anal, and cancer Helicobacter Pylori: Gastric (stomach) cancer HIV/AIDS: aggressive lymphoma subtypes, Kaposi's sarcoma, anorectal cancer, cervical cancer, etc.

 Schistosomiasis: increases risk of bladder cancer Liver Fluke: increases risk of cholangio-carcinoma Preventative measures to control oncogenic infection risk include vaccination, and prevention/treatment of infection and infestation:
 Engage in safe sexual behaviour to avoid sexually transmitted diseases that can cause or increase the risk of certain types of cancer such as cervical, Kaposi sarcoma, lymphoma, and liver cancers.

 HPV Vaccination: vaccinate all girls aged 10 years with 2 doses of HPV vaccine (for detail see section 18 on immunization)
 Hepatitis B Vaccination: routinely offered in the national childhood schedule and populations at risk, in order to prevent infection with hepatitis B, the main risk factor for liver cancer (for detail see section 18 on immunization)
 Treatment of HIV/AIDS, schistosomiasis, H. pylori, and hepatitis B&C and other infections is also a preventive measure.

## Radiation

~ Ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and in particular solar radiation, is carcinogenic to humans, causing all major types of skin cancer, such as basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma People with albinism are at a much higher risk of skin cancer and health workers should encourage them to wear protective clothing and wide brimmed hats
 
~ Ionizing radiation from radioactive isotopes (used in medical diagnostics and treatment) is also associated with leukaemia and other solid tissue tumours. Proper disposal of highly radioactive isotopes is mandatory to prevent hazardous exposures

## Prevention Of Infections

The following infections are associated with causing certain types of cancer:
~ Viral Hepatitis B/C: cancer of the liver
~ Human Papilloma Virus (HPV): cervical cancer ~ Helicobacter Pylori: stomach cancer HIV/AIDS: aggressive lymphoma subtypes, Kaposi's sarcoma, anorectal cancer, cervical cancer, etc
~ Schistosomiasis: increases risk of bladder cancer
~ Liver Fluke: increases risk of cholangio-carcinoma
~ Preventative measures to control infection risk include vaccination, and prevention/treatment of infection and infestation:
~ HPV Vaccination: immunize all girls from age 10 with 2 doses of HPV vaccine (see section 18.1)
~ Hepatitis B Vaccination: routinely offered in the national childhood schedule and populations at risk, in order to prevent infection with hepatitis B, the main risk factor for liver cancer (see section 18.2.2)
~ Treatment of HIV/AIDS, schistosomiasis, H. pylori, and hepatitis B&C and other infections is also a preventive measure

## 12.2.2 Secondary Prevention

Secondary prevention of cancer includes activities or actions directed at halting the progress of cancer at its incipient stage through screening, early diagnosis, pre-cancer treatment or cancer management, and referral to avoid or reduce complications associated with the cancer. 

Secondary prevention strategies relate to the discovery and control of cancerous or pre-cancerous lesions.

Early detection of cancer greatly increases the chances for successful treatment and cure. It comprises of:
~ Early diagnosis in symptomatic populations
~ Screening in asymptomatic high-risk populations Screening refers to the use of simple tests across a healthy population in order to identify individuals who have disease, but do not yet have symptoms.

Based on existing evidence, mass population screening is advocated for breast and cervical cancer. Other cancers that are commonly screened for include prostate and colorectal cancers

## Screening For Breast Cancer

Screening / health checkup for breast cancer involves: Breast Self-Examination (BSE): a simple, quick examination done by the client herself, aimed at early detection of lumps. Regular (monthly-not during menstruation, at least seven days after ending the menstruation) and correct technique of breast examination is important and easy to teach and administer. Health workers should note that BSE is not a standard screening test for breast cancer, but is beneficial for breast health awareness. Clinical Breast Examination (CBE): performed by a trained and skilled health care provider from HC3 Take a detailed history and conduct a physical examination All breast quadrants must be examined in detail plus the armpits for lymph nodes Inspect the skin for changes and swellings, for tethering of the breast on the chest wall, palpate for lumps, check for nipple discharge A suspicious lump or bloody nipple discharge MUST 
BE REFERRED for evaluation by mammography or ultrasonography as well as core needle biopsy Mammography: a low-dose x-ray of the breast is the test of choice for screening of early breast cancer but it is available only at national referral hospital level. Breast Ultrasound: not used as a screening test, but is useful as an additional tool in characterizing palpable tumors and taking of image-directed biopsies. It may be used as a screening tool in lactating women, small- breasted women and in males, and as diagnostic tests in symptomatic patients.

## Screening For Cervical Cancer

This aims to detect pre-cancerous lesions that are then treated to prevent progression to invasive cancer. The following methods are recommended: Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid (VIA): involves applying 3-5% freshly prepared acetic acid to the cervix and observing results after one minute.

 The VIA results are generally categorized into 3 subsets: 
suspicious for cancer, VIA negative and VIA positive It uses readily available equipment, does not require a laboratory and provides an immediate result. Positive cases can be treated with cryotherapy by adequately trained providers.

## Consider The Following If Using Via As A Screening Method:

 Women <25 years of age should be screened only if they are at high risk for disease: HIV positive, early sexual exposure, multiple partners, previous abnormal screening results, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)
 VIA is not appropriate for women >50 years Screening is advised every 3-5 years in case of normal results, but after 1 years in case of abnormal results and treatment (cryotherapy) nd every year in HIV positive women.

 Visual Inspection with Lugol's Iodine (VILI): it involves looking at the cervix with the naked eye or low magnification after swabbing with Lugol's iodine. VILI has a sensitivity and specificity of about 92% and 85%, respectively. Test results are available immediately thereby decreasing loss to follow-up. Recommendations and timings of VIA outlined above also apply to VILI.

 Cytology Testing by Pap Smear: it is a microscopic examination of cells scraped from the opening of the cervix. The PAP smear is best taken around mid-cycle. It should be postponed in case of cervicitis until after treatment; otherwise, the pus cells obscure clarity of the smear and affect interpretation. It requires histocytology services so it is available only at referral facilities.

 HPV DNA testing is currently being piloted as a standard screening test in Uganda.

## 12.3 Common Cancers

This section describes the signs and symptoms of common cancers in adults and children, and outline some of the investigations required. 

Health workers should suspect cancer if they observe any of these clinical features and refer patients to the cancer treatment centers (Uganda Cancer Institte and regional referral hospitals).

## 13. Palliative Care Icd10 Code: Z51.5

Palliative care aims to improve the quality of life of patients (and their families) who are faced with life-threatening illness, through the prevention and relief of suffering. This is achieved through early identification, ongoing assessment, treatment of pain and other physical, psychosocial and spiritual problems.

## 13.1 Pain

"Pain is what the patient says hurts" Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage. Pain is the most common symptom of a disease. The nature, location and cause of pain will differ in each case. Pain requires a holistic approach as it can be affected by spiritual, psychological, social, and cultural factors, which may need to be addressed after physical pain is controlled.

## Causes Of Pain

Pain can be divided into two types of causative categories:
~ Acute Pain: Caused by a specific action with a definite time period, e.g., postoperative, acute infection, or trauma
~ Chronic pain: Ongoing pain with an indefinite time period, for example Constant and usually increasing: cancer Recurrent sickle-cell crisis, arthritis, HIV/AIDS Drug side-effect or toxicity (e.g., peripheral neuropathy due to isoniazid, chemotherapy)
Risk factors and mitigators These factors increase pain perception:
~ Anxiety and depression, social abandonment ~ Insomnia
~ Lack of understanding of the problem These factors decrease pain perception:
~ Relaxation, sleep
~ Relief of other symptoms ~ Explanation/understanding, venting feelings

## 13.1.1 Clinical Features And Investigations

Types of Pain There are 2 types of pain that health workers need to be aware of:

| TYPE OF PAIN                                                                                        | FEATURES   |                                                                         |

## Clinical Investigation

It is important for health workers to conduct a thorough investigation of a patient indicating they are in pain. The following points can be used to guide the investigation:
~ Duration of pain
~ Severity: assess using the Numerical Rating Scale, where the patient grades his/her pain on a scale of 0 = no pain to 5
~ = worst pain ever experienced
~ Site and radiation
~ Nature (e.g., stabbing, throbbing, crushing, cramp-like) ~ Periodicity (constant or intermittent)
~ Relieving or aggravating factors
~ Accompanying symptoms
~ Ask the patient for a detailed history for each pain experienced, as there may be more than one type of pain and area experiencing pain
~ A targeted physical examination

## 13.1.2 Nociceptive Pain Management

There are two goals of pain management:
~ Diagnose and treat the disease causing the pain
~ Achieve total pain relief with minimal side-effects and enable the patient to live as normal a life as possible
~ Pain can be treated through use of medicines and/or nondrug treatment CHAPTER 13: **Palliative Care**

## General Principles In Use Of Opioids

~ Health professionals specially trained in palliative care should supervise management of chronic pain in advanced or incurable conditions (e.g., cancer, AIDS)
~ Morphine is usually the drug of choice for severe pain. 

Liquid morphine is available, easy to dose, and is well absorbed from the oral mucosae and can be dripped in the mouth of adults and children
~ In continuous pain, analgesics should be given:
 By the clock (i.e. according to a regular dose schedule)
 By the patient (i.e. self-administered)
 By the mouth (i.e. as oral dose forms)
~ Pain is better controlled using regular oral doses which control pain. If pain is not controlled, increase the 24-hour dose by 30-50%
 Repeated injections are not indicated
~ Consider extra doses when painful procedure is planned and for breakthrough pain. If using breakthrough doses regularly, then increase the regular dose!

~ Side effects are minor and well-manageable if careful dosing and titration are done

## Cautions On Use Of Opioids

Opioids need to be effectively managed and administered, considering the associated cautions and side effects below. r Do not use opioids in severe respiratory depression and

## Head Injury

 Use with care in the following conditions Advanced liver disease (but can be used in hepatocellular carcinoma when titrated as above)
 Acute asthma Acute abdominal pain (can use while awaiting diagnostic tests; never leave the patient in pain)
 Hypothyroidism
 
 Renal failure (reduce starting dose and/or reduce dose frequency)
 Elderly or severely wasted patient (reduce starting dose and/or reduce dose frequency) Use with extreme care (i.e., start with small doses and use small incremental increases) in:
 Recurrent or concurrent intake of alcohol or other CNS depressants

## Management Of Side Effects Of Opioids

| SIDE EFFECT   | MANAGE AS:   |
|---------------|--------------|
| Respiratory depression ƒ Rarely occurs if small oral doses are used and gradually  titrated to response ƒ Can occur when morphine used parenterally ‰ Reverse respiratory depression using naloxone 0.4-2 mg slow  IV every 2-3 minutes according to response Child: 0.01 mg/kg slow IV; repeat 0.1 mg/kg if no response Constipation ‰ Give Bisacodyl 10-15 mg nocte to prevent  constipation except if diarrhoea is present  Child: 5 mg rectally ‰ Add liquid paraffin 10 ml once a day if bisacodyl  is not enough Nausea or  ‰ Usually occurs in first 5 days and is self-limiting Vomiting ‰ Vomiting later on may be due to another cause ‰ Give anti-emetic (e.g. ‰ metoclopramide 10 mg ‰ every 8 hours for 3–5 days) Child 9-18 yrs: 5 mg 8 hourly Child 5-9 yrs: 2.5 mg 8 hourly Child 3-9 yrs: 2-2.5 mg 8 hourly Child 1-3 yrs: 1 mg 8 hourly Child <1 yr: 100 micrograms per kg every 12 hours               |              |

| SIDE EFFECT   | MANAGE AS:                  |                                             |
|---------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Confusion or  | ‰                             | If excessive continuous drowsiness, titrate |
| Drowsiness    | the opioid dose down slowly |                                             |

## Referral Criteria

~ If pain does not respond to above measures, refer to pal- liative care specialist
~ Refer for radiotherapy at national referral hospital for se- vere bone pain not responding to above medications
~ Refer for surgery if the cause of pain is amenable to sur- gery

## 13.1.3 Neuropathic Pain

Neuropathic pain occurs as a result of damage to nerve tissue. There are two clinical kinds of neuropathic pain, both elements may be combined:
~ Stabbing-type: pain in a nerve distribution with minimal pain in between (e.g. trigeminal neuralgia) but can occur with any nerve. Responds to Phenytoin
~ Paraesthesia dysaesthesiae, or burning-type pain: (e.g. 

post-herpetic neuralgia). Responds well to small doses of Amitriptyline

| TREATMENT                                  | LOC   |
|--------------------------------------------|-------|
| Trigeminal neuralgia or stabbing-type pain | HC3   |
| Acute phase ‰ Carbamazepine initially 100 mg every 12 hours ƒ Increase gradually by 200 mg every 2-3 days  according to response, max 1200 mg ƒ Causes white cell depression Burning type pain (post-herpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy) ‰ Amitriptyline 12.5-25 mg at night or every ‰ 12 hours depending on response, max 50-75 mg                                            | HC3   |

CHAPTER 13: **Palliative Care**

## 13.1.4 Back Or Bone Pain

Includes pain in the lumbar region of the spine or bone pain anywhere within the body.

Causes Potential causes of back or bone pain:
~ Disc degeneration (often has a neuropathic element be- cause of pressure on sciatic or other nerve)
~ Osteoporosis (if collapse of vertebrae or fracture)
Infection (e.g. TB, brucellosis, PID, retroperitoneal)
~ Metastatic cancers, renal disease ~ Strain
~ Congenital abnormalities
~ Spondylolisthesis

## Clinical Features

Each situation will differ depending on the cause of the pain
~ If an infection is present: throbbing and constant pain
~ If sciatica, sciatic nerve roots will be involved Investigations Try to establish the cause and type of pain X-ray: Spine and pelvis Management of Back or Bone Pain

## 13.2.8 Other Symptoms 13.2.9 End Of Life Care

Care in the last days of life. 

CHAPTER 13: **Palliative Care**

## Clinical Features

Clinical signs at of end of life include (should be considered in those with terminal conditions who have been gradually deteriorating):
~ Patient becomes bed-bound and is increasingly drowsy or in a semi-conscious state
~ Minimal oral intake; patient not managing oral medication and only able to take sips of fluid
~ The patient's condition is deteriorating rapidly (e.g. day by day or hour by hour)
~ Breathing becomes irregular +/- noisy (death rattle)
~ Changes in skin colour and/ or temperature
~ Limited attention span

## Investigations

 Exclude reversible problems (e.g. drug toxicity, infections, de- hydration, biochemical abnormalities)
 Before ordering a test, always ask "will this test change my management plan or the outcome for the patient?"
 It is important to weigh the benefit versus the burden in assessing an intervention, and/or management plan based on the clinical features exhibited by the patient

| TREATMENT   | LOC HC2   |
|-------------|-----------|
| General principles of medicine treatment ‰ Focus on giving medication that will improve the pa- tient's quality of life ‰ Treat symptoms of discomfort as in sections above ‰ If the patient is unable to swallow choose an appropriate  route to give necessary medications (e.g., via NG tube,  parenteral or rectally) ‰ Subcutaneous (SC) is recommended when the enteral  route is not possible. It is preferred over IV and IM  access due to its reduced trauma and pharmacokinetics             |           |

| ‰             | If repeated injections are anticipated or experienced, a  butterfly needle can be inserted and used as a route for  regular SC injections |       |
| ‰             | Consider prescribing medications pre-emptively (antic- ipatory) to combat developing symptoms                                             |       |
| ‰             | Morphine concentrations can vary depending on the  preparation used; remember that SC morphine has twice  the potency of oral morphine    |       |
| Hydration and nutrition ‰ Patients should eat and drink as they wish, and take  sips of water as long as they are able ‰ Families should be educated that it is normal for patients  to lose their appetite, have a sense of thirst and stop  feeding towards the end of life. ‰ They should not feed patients if they are no longer able  to swallow as this may cause choking and distress ‰ IV fluids at this stage will not prolong life or prevent  thirst. Over-hydration is discouraged as it may contrib- ute to distressing respiratory secretions or generalised  oedema; good regular mouthcare is the best way to keep  the patient comfortable ‰ IV dextrose for calorie supplementation is unlikely to  be of benefit ‰ If there is a reduced level of consciousness, patients  should not be fed due to the risk of aspiration. ‰ Artificial nutrition is generally discouraged at the end of life Supportive care ‰ Keep the patient clean and dry ‰ Regularly clean the mouth with a moist cloth wrapped  round a spoon ‰ Prevent and manage pressure sores appropriately ‰ Manage any associated pain             |                                                                                                                                           |       |

## 14.1.1 Dysmenorrhoea Icd10 Code: N94.6

Abdominal pain that occurs just before or during menstruation. Symptoms begin about 12 hours before onset of menses and last for 1–3 days.

Primary dysmenorrhoea occurs more commonly among adolescents and young women. Symptoms usually begin 6–12 months after menarche and occur mainly with ovulatory cycles. Generally, severity of symptoms decreases with age, sexual activity and child birth.

Secondary dysmenorrhoea is usually due to a gynaecological condition such as infection or fibroids, and usually occurs in older women above 30 years.

Causes of primary dysmenorrheaoa
~ Not known Causes of secondary dysmenorrhoea
~ Pelvic inflammatory disease ~ Endometriosis
~ Uterine fibroids

## Clinical Features

~ Lower abdominal cramping ~ Backache, headache
~ Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, fainting, fever, fatigue, dizziness CHAPTER 13: **Palliative Care**

~ Night sweats, palpitations, headaches, insomnia, tiredness
~ Irregular menstruation till cessation
~ Vaginal atrophy and dryness, loss of libido, painful inter- course
~ Bladder irritability, incontinence, UTIs
~ Weight gain (sometimes)
~ Skin changes: dryness, thinning, loss of head hair, in- crease or loss of body hair)
~ Mood swings, emotional changes (e.g. depression, irrita- bility, short temperedness, weepiness)
~ Lack of concentration, failing memory
~ Osteoporosis, denture problem
~ **Investigations**
~ Exclude pregnancy

![0_image_0.png](0_image_0.png)

For further detailed information on Family Planning (FP) and Maternal Health, please refer to "Procedure Manual for Family Planning and Maternal Health Service Delivery MOH, 2016". Family planning is a basic human right for an individual and couples to exercise control over their fertility, make informed decision on the number of children they want to have, plan pregnancies, and the space between pregnancies. FP has health benefits for the mother and the children and economic benefits for the family and the country at large.

15.1 Key steps to be followed in provision of fp services Icd10 code: z10.0 1. Provide information about FP, including preconception care to different groups 2. Counsel clients at high risk of unwanted pregnancies to accept/
use FP services 3. Counsel clients to make informed choice of FP methods, including dual methods 4. Obtain and record client history 5. Perform a physical assessment 6. Perform a pelvic examination 7. Screen for cervical cancer and HIV
8. Manage client according to chosen FP method CHAPTER 14: **Gynecological Conditions**

## 15.1.1 Provide Information About Fp Including Pre-Conceptioncare To Different Groups

The procedures used here are also used in the next step to recruit clients for FP and maternal health services in young child, antenatal, labour and delivery wards, outpatients, outreach, and postpartum clinics and in providing education on specific chosen FP methods. The objective is to:
~ Create awareness
~ Disseminate correct information to influence people to change beliefs, attitudes and practices
~ Recruit new clients and offer several FP methods

## 15.1.2 Counsel High-Risk Clients

Risk factors to look out for in clients include:
~ Recent delivery/abortion ~ >4 pregnancies
~ >35 years old or <20 years old
~ Complicating medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, heart disease)
~ People living with HIV/AIDS
~ Having children with birth interval <2 years
~ Poor obstetric history, which is likely to recur in future pregnancies (e.g., postpartum haemorrhage, pre- eclampsia)
Identify eligible women (non-pregnant) while conducting clinics such as:
~ Young child clinics and paediatric wards ~ Maternity and postnatal clinics and wards
~ Outpatient clinics

## Chapter 14: Gynecological Conditions

~ Youths and Adolescent centers ~ HIV/AIDS care centers/ ART clinics
~ Sexual Reproductive Health clinics (e.g. Cervical cancer, Post abortion care, Adolescent/Youth clinics)
~ Male clinics
~ Gender based violence clinics/ corners You can also identify the eligible women while:
~ Conducting outreaches (Immunisation or Home visits)
Discuss with clients about reproductive choices and risk factors. Give special consideration to first time parents and adolescents in provision of appropriate information on sexuality, family planning and family planning services: types, benefits, availability and procedures.

## 15.1.3 Pre-Conception Care With Clients Who Desire To Conceive

Pre-conception care discussion topics for clients who desire to conceive include:
~ Pregnancy planning and appropriate contraception
~ Folic acid supplementation 3 months preceeding conception ~ Good diet, risk assessment and management of pre existing conditions and risk factors
~ Benefits of preconception care (e.g., prevention of unintended pregnancies, good maternal and foetal outcomes)
~ Screening for hereditary diseases e.g., sickle cell disease ~ Screening for STI, including HIV and hepatitis

## Chapter 15: Family Planning (Fp)

# 15.1.4 Discuss With Plw Hiv Special Consideration For Hiv Transmission

Key areas for discussion include:
~ Prevention of HIV transmission to spouse and child ~ Safer sexual practices and safe conception
~ Education/counseling about perinatal transmission risk
~ Initiation or modification of ART considering toxicity
~ Evaluation of opportunistic infections and offering ummarizedn
~ Some ARV drugs may interact and reduce the effect of hormonal contraceptives. It is always ummarize to use additional barrier methods (condoms), which also prevent STIs.

## 15.1.5 Educate And Counsel Clients To Make Informed Choice Of Fp Method

The primary objectives are:
9. To dispel any rumours and misconceptions about FP 10. To help the client make a voluntary informed choice Procedure
~ Prepare the room/materials needed, ensuring privacy
~ Assess client's knowledge and experience of FP methods
~ Explain about different FP methods available Type Mechanism of action and method of use Advantages and disadvantages Indications Contraindications Side-effects Complications/warning signs Check understanding Help client choose appropriate method using family planning medical eligibility criteria wheel (see summary of wheel in section 15.1.10 below)
~ Explain next steps needed

## 15.1.6 Obtain And Record Client History

## 15.2 Overview Of Key Contraceptive Methods

The following sections contain an overview of mainstream contraceptive methods and how to manage side effects of each (in case they occur). Side effects are one of most common reasons why women stop using contraception, and the health worker should be able to counsel the patient and address her concerns appropriately.

## 15.2.1 Condom (Male) Icd10 Code: Z30.018/Z30.49

For example no-logo donation condoms, branded condoms. 

Indications
~ Couples needing an immediately effective method
~ Where this is preferred FP method by client
~ Couples waiting to rule out suspected pregnancy
~ Protection against exposure to STIs including HIV/AIDS
~ Where back-up method is needed, e.g. when womanis starting or has forgotten to take oral contraceptives
~ Couples where one or both partners have HIV/AIDS, 
even if using another FP method Advantages
~ Male plays role in FP
~ Protects against unwanted pregnancy
~ Also protects against STIs and HIV infection

## Disadvantages

~ Some men may have difficulty maintaining an erection with condom on
~ May cause insensitivity of the penis
~ Occasional hypersensitivity to latex or lubricants (may result in a severe allergic reaction)
~ Requires correct use with every act of sex for greatest effectiveness

| ~            | In case of hypersensitivity to latex or lubricants,  avoid latex based condoms, and use the female  condom or another FP method |       |

CHAPTER 15: **Family Planning (FP)**
For example Femidom, Care and FC2.

A soft plastic pre-lubricated sheath with an inner and outer ring which is inserted into the vagina before sexual intercourse.

## Indications

~ As for condoms (male) above
~ For women whose partners will not use male condom
~ Where the man has allergy/sensitivity to latex condom

## Advantages

~ Woman-controlled (but requires partner's cooperation) ~ Can be inserted hours before intercourse and so does not interrupt sexual spontaneity
~ Not dependent on male erection and does not require immediate withdrawal after ejaculation
~ Protects against STI and HIV infection
~ No special storage required Disadvantages and Side-Effects
~ Requires special training and practice to use correctly
~ Relatively new product with limited public awareness
~ In some cases, hypersensitivity to polyurethane female condoms occurs
~ Requires correct use with every act of sex for greatest effectiveness

## 16.2 Management Of Selected Conditions In Pregnancy

16.2.1 Anaemia in Pregnancy ICD10 CODE: 099.019 Anaemia is the most frequent and major complication of pregnancy. It may be defined as haemoglobin level below the normal (11 g/dL for pregnant women). For second trimester the cut off is 10.5g/dL.

## Causes

~ Nutritional causes; iron deficiency, folic acid deficiency
~ Infections and infestations; hookworm infestation, malaria, UTI, HIV/AIDS
~ Haemorrhagic causes: bleeding in pregnancy, trauma ~ Haemoglopathies eg. Sickle cell anaemia, thalassemias ~ Malignancies ~ Due to medications from HIV /Cancer treatment
~ Any other causes

Mother may give history of
~ Gradual onset of exhaustion or weakness ~ Swelling of the legs ~ Dyspnoea, dizziness, and palpitations On examination
~ Pallor of the conjunctiva, tongue, palm, vagina, etc., of varying degree, depending on the severity of anaemia
~ Glossitis and stomatitis ~ Oedema of the legs
~ In very severe cases: evidence of heart failure such as engorged neck veins, dyspnoea, hepatomegally, ascites, gallop rhythm, and oedema

## Complications

~ Untreated anaemia may increase the risk of premature labour, poor intrauterine foetal growth, weak uterine contractions, foetal hypoxia, postpartum haemorrhage, poor lactation, post-partum sepsis

## Investigations

 Blood Hb (<11 g/dL is considered abnormal) Peripheral smear to determine the type of anaemia and presence of malaria parasites HB electrophoresis Stool: ova and cysts of hookworm infestation Management

## 16.2.2 Pregnancy And Hiv Infection

All HIV services for pregnant mothers are offered in the MCH clinic. After delivery, mother and baby will remain in the MCH postnatal clinic until HIV status of the child is confirmed, then they will be transferred to the general ART clinic.

All pregnant mothers and partners should receive routine counselling and testing for HIV.

If mother tests negative:
~ Counsel on HIV prevention
~ Repeat test in third trimester/during labour and delivery If mother tests positive or is already known positive but not yet on ART
~ Enroll on HIV care (eMTCT).

If mother is already positive and already on ART:
~ Continue on their existing regimen; may not be switched to
~ Option B+ regimens
~ Perform viral load at first contact
 
For more information on HIV, including clinical diagnosis, management, and psychosocial support, refer to specific HIV/AIDS guidelines (see chapter 3).

## 16.2.2.1 Care For Hiv Positive Women (Emtct) Icd10 Code: 098.719

Ensure the following care is provided during pregnancy, labour, delivery, and postpartum period for all HIV+ women
~ Find out what she has told her partner (degree of disclosure), labour companion, and family support. Respect her choice and desired confidentiality

| During labour: safe obstetric practices ƒ Avoid episiotomy ƒ Avoid artifical rupture of membranes ƒ Avoid instrumental delivery (vacuum) ƒ Avoid frequent vaginal examination ƒ Do not milk umbilical cord before cutting ƒ Actively manage third stage of labour Baby (see section 3.1.9.3)   | HC3                                                                                             |

~ and lactating women, to less than 5% in breastfeeding populations, and to less than 2% in non-breastfeeding populations
~ Improved health, and reduced maternal mortality and morbidity of HIV-infected mothers through lifelong ART
~ Reduction of the risk of HIV transmission to non-HIV- infected sexual partner in discordant relationship
~ Reduction in the number of HIV/AIDS orphans
~ Contribution to the achievement of the 90/90/90 goals by 2020
~ Contributes to achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030

## 16.2.2.2 Counselling For Hiv Positive Mothers

~ Give psychosocial support ~ Encourage mothers to enroll in Family Support Groups 
(FSG) for peer support
~ Advise on the importance of good nutrition Talk to family members to encourage the woman to eat enough and help her avoid hard physical work Micronutrient supplementation during pregnancy and breastfeeding; iron + folic acid and multivitamins
~ Advise her that she is more liable to infections, and to seek medical help as soon as possible
~ Review the birth plan Advise her to continue attending ANC Advise her to deliver in a health facility where appropriate care can be provided for her and the baby Advise her to go to the health facility as soon as labour starts or membranes rupture

## During Postpartum Period

~ Advise on the infectiousness of lochia and blood- stained sanitary pads, and how to dispose them off safely according to local facilities
~ If not breastfeeding exclusively, advise her to use a family planning method immediately to prevent unwanted pregnancy
~ Linkage of mother-baby pair and her family, for on-going care beyond peurperium
~ Breast care: If not breastfeeding, advise that:
 The breasts may be uncomfortable for a while She should avoid expressing the breast to remove milk (the more you remove the more it forms)
 She should support her breasts with a firm, well-fitting bra or cloth, and give her paracetamol for painful breasts Advise her to seek care if breasts become painful, swollen, red; if she feels ill; or has fever Counselling on infant feeding choice
~ Begin infant feeding counselling before birth when the pregnant mother has been identified to be HIV positive.

~ The decision on how she will feed the baby should be made before delivery. The mother should then be supported to implement the feeding option she has chosen
~ All mothers are encouraged to breastfeed their babies exclusively for 6 months and then introduce complimentary feeding until 1 year
~ The mother has to continue her ARVs all through breastfeeding
~ The child should continue cotrimoxazole prophylaxis, until status confirmed negative with a PCR at 6 weeks after stopping breastfeeding CHAPTER 16: **Obstetric Conditions**
 
CHAPTER 16: **Obstetric Conditions**
~ If a mother chooses to feed the newborn on replacement feeding from the beginning, the choice of replacement feeds should fulfil the AFASS Criteria (Affordable, Feasible, Available, Sustainable and Safe).

## 16.2.3 Chronic Hypertension In Pregnancy Icd 10 Code: O10, O13

Blood pressure >140/90 present before the pregnancy or starting before 20 weeks. Pregnant women with chronic hypertension should continue to follow the lifestyle modifications for controlling hypertension such as:
~ No alcohol
~ Regular moderate exercise, brisk walking for 30 minutes at least 3 times a week
~ Smoking cessation.

Health worker should:
~ Ask mother about foetal movements at each visit
~ Aim for BP <140/90 mmHg

Prevention and control of malaria in pregnancy
~ Use insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITN) before, during, and after pregnancy.

~ Give all pregnant women intermittent preventive treatment (IPTp) with sulfadoxine pyrimethamine (SP) - Except in allergy to sulphonamide
~ Prompt diagnosis and effective treatment of malaria in pregnancy Education messages to mothers and the community
~ Malaria is transmitted by female anopheles mosquitoes
~ Pregnant women and children are at particular risk of malaria
~ If untreated, malaria can cause severe anaemia and death in pregnant women
~ Malaria can lead to anaemia, miscarriage, stillbirth, mentally-retarded children, or low birth weight children, who are more prone to infant/childhood mortality compared to normal weight children
~ It is better and cheaper to prevent than to treat malaria
~ The individual, family, and the community can control malaria by taking appropriate actions
~ Sleeping under an insecticide-treated mosquito netis the best way to prevent malaria
~ It is very important to complete the course of treatment in order to achieve a cure
~ Severe complicated malaria needs special management, therefore refer

## 16.2.5 Diabetes In Pregnancy Icd10 Code: O24

## 16.3.2 Vaginal Bleeding In Early Pregnancy/ Abortion Icd10 Code: O20

This is almost always abnormal, and patients may need to be admitted or referred. The most common causes of bleeding in the first six months (<26 weeks gestation) are abortion and ectopic pregnancy Abortion (miscarriage) occurs when the foetus is lost before 28 weeks of pregnancy.

 
Cause Not known in the majority of patients May be intentional (induced abortion)
 May be spontaneous (often as a result of fever)
 If mother has more than 2 miscarriages, refer for assessment Differential diagnosis Pregnancy outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy) Other causes of bleeding from the vagina, e.g. cancer Other causes of lower abdominal pain, e.g. PID
Investigations Urine: Pregnancy test Ultrasound Blood: Complete count Clinical features, terminology and management Depend on the stage of the abortion See table below.

## Chapter 16: Obstetric Conditions

Risk factors History of prior ectopic pregnancy Prior abdominal or tubal surgery History of PID, endometriosis, history of infertility Cigarette smoking Multiple sexual partners Clinical features There may be a period of amenorrhoea as in normal pregnancy Lower abdominal pain, often acute and followed by slight bleeding from the vagina If the tube ruptures, the patient may suddenly become anaemic and go into shock Abdomen may be very tender with rebound tenderness and guarding on palpation Abdomen may not be moving with normal breathing Tenderness of moving cervix during vaginal examination There may be features of free fluid in the abdomen Differential diagnosis Other causes of acute abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding, e.g., twisted ovarian cyst Appendicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease Incomplete abortion Investigations Usually diagnosed clinically
- If the tube ruptures, there may be little time for investigations but ultrasound could be useful (if the patient is not in shock)
 Pregnancy test (to exclude other causes)
 Complete blood count, blood grouping and cross-matching

Note DO NOT RUN A LOT OF FLUIDS BEFORE SURGERY, as this raises blood pressure, which may worsen the patient's bleeding, and worsen state of shock.

## 16.3.4 Premature Rupture Of Membranes (Prom & Pprom) Icd10 Code: O42

PROM is a rupture of membranes before the start of labour. It can occur either:
- When foetus is mature/term at or after 37 weeks (PROM) - Or when foetus is immature/preterm between 24-37 weeks of gestation. This is referred to as Pre-term PROM (PPROM).

In all cases of PPROM, prematurity and its attendant problems are the principal concerns for the foetus, while infection morbidity and its complications are the primary concerns for the mother.

Risk factors associated with PPROM
Low socioeconomic status, tobacco use Low body mass index Prior history of PV bleeding during pregnancy History of preterm labour Urinary tract infection, chorioamnionitis Cervical cerclage, amniocentesis Clinical features associated with PROM
 Leakage of fluid or vaginal discharge May be with or without vaginal bleeding Pelvic pressure but no contractions If ROM has been prolonged, the patient may present with fever, abdominal pain, and a foul smelling vaginal discharge

## Investigation

 The typical odour of amniotic fluid is diagnostic Place a vaginal pad over the vulva; examine visually and by smell after 1 hour Use a high-level disinfected or sterile speculum for vagina examination: fluid may be seen coming from the cervix or forming a pool in the posterior fornix Ask patient to cough: this may cause a gush of fluid If membrane rupture is not recent or leakage is gradual, confirming the diagnosis may be difficult Abdominal US scan may show absence of or very low amounts of amniotic fluid If available, do Nitrazine test and Ferning test

## Caution

 Do NOT do digital vaginal examination - it does not help diagnosis and may cause infection Management of PROM (>37 weeks)
 Over 90% of patients with PROM go into spontaneous labour within 24 hours Expectant management carries a risk of infection Induction of labour decreases the risk of infection without increasing the C/S delivery rate Expectant management also carries a risk of neonatal issues, e.g., infection, abruptio placenta, foetal distress, foetal restriction deformities, and death

| ‰              | Refer to HC4 or above (with facilities for emergency  obstetric management) for induction with oxytocin (see  section 16.4.2) |           |

## Management Of Pprom (<37 Weeks)

 The primary determinant of neonatal morbidity and mortality is gestational age at delivery, hence stressing the need for conservative management whenever possible for Pre-PROM
 All patients with Pre-PROM should receive antenatal steroids for foetal lung maturity All patients with PPROM should receive prophylactic antibiotics since there is a high risk of infection Administration of tocolytics for 48 hours may allow administration of steroids to accelerate lung maturity In general, prognosis is good after 34 weeks of gestation All patients with PPROM should be cared for in a facility where a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) is available CHAPTER 16: **Obstetric Conditions**

## 16.3.7 Pre-Eclampsia Icd10 Code: O14

Pre-eclampsia is a hypertensive condition of pregnancy usually diagnosed after 20 weeks of gestation and can present as late as 4-6 weeks postpartum. It is haracterized with hypertension, proteinuria with or without oedema and, may result into maternal fits if not managed appropriately. It may also be superimposed on chronic hypertension. It is classified as mild to severe pre-eclampsia.

| TYPE OF ECLAMPSIA                | DESCRIPTION A diastolic BP of 90-109 mmHg and/ or                                                                                                                                                    |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mild to moderate pre-ec- lampsia | systolic BP of 140-159 mmHg, with ³1+  proteinuria; and no organ dysfunction                                                                                                                         |
| Severe pre- eclampsia            | acute severe hypertension (160/110  mmHg) and ³1+ proteinuria OR any  degree of hypertension with evidence of  organ dysfunction (e.g., renal dysfunction,  raised liver enzymes, thrombocytopaenia) |

Clinical features of severe pre-eclampsia Headache, blurring of vision of new onset Epigastric or right upper quadrant pain, vomiting Dyspnoea, weakness or general malaise Oedema (swelling of hands, face, legs and other parts of the body), excessive weight gain Systolic BP >160 mmHg and Diastolic BP >110 mmHg Urine protein ++, may be oliguria Pre-elampsia related hypertension usually resolves spontaneously after delivery and almost always within 12 weeks from delivery.

## Differential Diagnosis

 Other causes of oedema and hypertension, e.g., renal diease)
Investigations Urine: for protein Blood for:
- LFT & RFT - Serum creatinine - Clotting time if platelet count is less than 100 X 109 - Fibrinogen levels Ultrasound Scan for foetal Estimated Gestational Age and viability

Any case of pre-eclampsia has to be referred to hospital, lower facilities can give emergency care (Magnesium sulphate, antihypertensive as available).

Goals of treatment are to:
 Prevent convulsions Control blood pressure Deliver the baby if indicated

# 16.4 Labour, Delivery And Acute Complications

16.4.1 Normal Labour and Delivery ICD10 CODE: O80 Labour is a physiological process by which the uterus expels the foetus Prevention Regular attendance of good antenatal care with a skilled birth attendant, and checking of blood pressure and urine protein.

and other products of conception. Labour can last from between 6 to 18 hours; being longer for first pregnancies.

Normal labour is characterized by:
 Onset of regular uterine contractions at term Progressive cervical dilatation Expulsion of the foetus FIRST STAGE OF LABOUR
 From onset of labour to full dilation of the cervix The presenting part descends well into the midpelvis What to do Provide rapid counselling and testing for HIV if it was not done during prenatal period Make correct diagnosis of labour Open a partogram for the patient and monitor progress of labour Vaginal examinations every 2 to 4 hours. Expected rate of cer- vical dilatation is at least 1 cm/hour. Examine every hour once an 8 cm dilatation has been reached Observe change of shape of foetal head (moulding), foetal position, and caput. Descent is assessed by abdominal palpation noting how much of the head you can feel above the pelvis Check uterine contractions Hourly monitoring of mother's BP, temperature, pulse and res- piration. Check ketones and proteins in urine, and Hb Check foetal heart rate (FHR) for 1 minute every 30 minutes. 

A normal FHR is 120 to 160 beats per minute; FHR >160 or 
<120 beats per minute indicates foetal distress Observe state of membranes and colour of amniotic fluid if membranes are ruptured Hydration and nourishment Ensure oral or IV fluid intake especially in prolonged labour, to avoid dehydration and ketosis Give normal saline and Dextrose solution as required Analgesia Provide appropriate analgesia if desired by the patient e.g. 

morphine 10 mg IM stat at 4-6 cm dilatation

## 16.4.2 Induction Of Labour

Induction of labour may be indicated for medical reasons, like, pre-eclampsia, diabetes, post-term pregnancy.

However, possible risks of induction are:
 Failed induction Hyperstimulation syndrome, requiring emergency caesarean section.

Induction is contraindicated in para 5 and above and in patients with a previous scar. In these cases there is indication for caesarean section.

Causes Cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD) Large baby Foetal abnormalities: hydrocephalus, conjoined twins Small or deformed pelvis Malpresentation: the presenting part of the foetus is not the head, e.g. breech presentation, shoulder presentation, face, etc Malposition: an abnormal position of the foetal head when this is the presenting part, e.g. occipito-posterior Any barrier that prevents the baby's descent down the birth canal

 Contractions are strong but no evidence of descent of the presenting part Malposition or malpresentation may be felt on abdominal examination In a first delivery, the pains will just stop spontaneously Foetal distress with meconium stained liqour Fever and dehydration with maternal exhaustion In late stages, the regular colicky strong pains may stop when the uterus is ruptured, and be replaced by a dull continuous pain Signs of shock if the uterus has ruptured Physical examination reveals signs of shock, tender uterus, formation of a Bandl's ring, vulva may be oedematous, vagi-

## 16.4.4 Ruptured Uterus Icd10 Code: O71.1

Partial or complete tearing of the uterus, common in:
 Multiparous women (i.e. have had >1 live babies) Women with previous caesarean section

## Causes/Predisposing Factors

 Assisted deliveries/obstetric procedures Neglected obstructed labour Tearing of a poorly-healed uterine scar during labour Short interpregnancy interval of less than 18 months after Caeserean Section Previous history of uterine surgery, e.g. myomectomy Damage to uterus due to a blow, e.g. kick or accident Use of oxytocic herbs

 Cessation of regular uterine contractions (labour pains)
 Continuous abdominal pain Vaginal bleeding Anxiety, anaemia, and shock Abdomen is irregular in shape Foetal parts easily felt under the skin if the foetusis outside uterus and foetal heart is not heard

## Differential Diagnosis

 Abruptio placentae Placenta praevia Other causes of acute abdomen in late pregnancy Ruptured spleen Bowel obstruction Investigations Blood: CBC, grouping and cross-matching Management Mothers with a suspicion of ruptured uterus should be referred immediately to hospital for blood transfusion and surgical management.

## Prevention

 Good ANC and education on early arrival to the facility for labour and delivery Skilled birth attendance at all deliveries Careful monitoring of labour using a partogram Minimise the use of oxytocin in multiparous women Do not attempt fundal pressure during labour DO NOT use misoprostol for induction of labor

## 16.4.5 Retained Placenta Icd10 Code: O73

Failure of delivery of placenta within 30 minutes of delivery of the baby.

Causes Poor management of 3rd stage of labour Failure of the uterus to contract Failure of the placenta to separate, e.g. if it is stuck in uterine muscle; placenta accreta Closing of the cervix before the placenta is expelled

 The umbilical cord protrudes from the vagina Bleeding may be present (in partial separation) Uterus may be poorly contracted and high in the abdomen May be signs of infection, e.g. fever, unpleasant bloody discharge if the placenta is retained for long Differential diagnosis Retained second twin Ruptured uterus Investigations Blood: Hb, grouping and cross-matching Management

16.4.6 Postpartum Haemorrhage (PPH) ICD10 CODE: O72 Vaginal bleeding of more than 500 mL after vaginal delivery or >1000 mL after caesarean section.

- Primary PPH occurs in the first 24 hours after delivery - Secondary PPH occurs between 24 hours and six weeks after delivery PPH is an EMERGENCY. It can occur in any woman and needs prompt recognition and treatment.

## Causes

 Tone: failure of uterus to contract, precipitated labour Tissues: such as retained placenta (in part or whole) or membranes which may lead to atony as well as infection in the uterus Tears (e.g. damage to/rupture of the perineum, vagina, cervix or uterus)
 Thrombotic disorders which may be due to DIC following abruptio placenta or severe APH

## High Risk Patients

 History of previous PPH, multiple previous C/S, multiple pregnancy Placenta praevia, abruptio placenta Precipitated labour, prolonged labour, large baby Patients with hypertensive disorders

 Bleeding from the genital tract which may be a gush of blood or a small but persistent trickle of blood (>1 pad soaked in five minutes)
 The uterus may still be large, soft, and not contracted escially in primary PPH
 If uterus is well contracted, look for tears on the perineum, vagina, cervix, or uterus Signs of shock may be present: tachycardia, low BP, cold and clammy skin In secondary PPH, there may be signs of infection, e.g., 
fever, abdominal tenderness

## Investigations

 Hb and blood group should have been already done and recorded during ANC; if not, do them urgently Women at high risk of PPH should have blood cross- matched and at least 2 units booked If time allows (e.g. in secondary PPH), check blood for Hb, clotting

The principles of management include two major components: 1. Resuscitation and management of obstetric haemorrhage and possibly hypovolemic shock 2. Identification and management of underlying causes

 Controlled cord traction during a contraction with counter-traction to deliver the placenta Massage the uterus immediately after delivery of the placenta to ensure the uterus is contracted Identify mothers at risk and manage accordingly Give 5 days' prophylactic antibiotics in prolonged or obstructed labour, or in presence of other risk factors, e.g. 

rupture of membranes, birth before arrival at health facility, instrument delivery:
 NOTE: Carbetocin should be given as a single dose

## 16.4.7 Puerperal Fever/Sepsis Icd10 Code: O85

Infection of the female internal genital tract within 6 weeks of childbirth. Signs and symptoms usually occur after 24 hours, although the disease may manifest earlier in settings of prolonged rupture of membranes and prolonged labour without prophylactic antibiotics.

## Causes

 Ascending infection from contamination during delivery or abortion Bacteria include: Staphylococcus aureus and Gram- negative bacteria from the gut, e.g. Escherichia coli, Bacteroides, Streptococcus pyogenes, clostridium spp, chlamydia, gonococci In peurperal sepsis, multiple organisms are likely

 Persistent fever >38°C Chills and general malaise Pain in the lower abdomen Persistent bloody/pus discharge (lochia) from genital tract, which may have an unpleasant smell Tenderness on palpating the uterus Uterine sub-involution

## Risk Factors

 Anaemia, malnutrition in pregnancy Prolonged labour, prolonged rupture of membranes Frequent vaginal exams Traumatic delivery (instrumental deliveries, tears)
 Retained placenta Differential diagnosis Other causes of fever after childbirth, e.g. malaria, UTI, 
DVT, wound sepsis, mastitis/breast abscess, RTI
Investigations Blood: CBC, C&S, BS for malaria parasites / RDT
 Lochia: swab for C&S Urine: For protein, sugar, microscopy, C&S

Puerperal fever carries a high risk of sepsis with a high mortality, and needs immediate attention

## Prevention

 Proper attachment of baby on the breast Frequent emptying of the breast Ensure the baby is sucking on the areolar and not the nipple Manage breast engorgement if not breastfeeding, or lost baby 
(Refer to section on care of the mother and baby immediately after delivery)

## 16.6.4 Obstetric Fistula Icd10 Code: 071

Obstetric fistula is an abnormal communication between the birth canal, and either the bladder, ureters, or rectum. It is one of the major causes of maternal morbidity making the women with the condition suffer from constant urinary incontinence which can lead to skin infections, kidney disorder or death if left untreated.

## Causes

 Obstructed labour (main cause): most fistula develops in 2 weeks after an obstructed labour, causing an often expansive crush injury to the vaginal tissues Sexual abuse and rape (Gender-based violence)
 Complication of unsafe abortion Surgical trauma usually following a caesarean section Gynaecological cancers and radiotheraphy

## Predisposing Factors

 Lack of access to maternity care Lack of/inadequate skilled care at birth Lack of facilities for ANC and childbirth Lack of knowledge to identify danger signs and promptly respond Poverty and lack of women empowerment Early marriage and childbirth Inadequate family planning access Harmful traditional practices such as Female Genital Mutilation

 Unncontrolled leakage of urine or faeces from vagina Differential diagnosis Stress, urge or overflow incontinence Ureterovaginal fistula (UVF)

## Investigations

 Speculum examination to visualise leakage; site, size and amount Confirm by dye test on pelvic examination/speculum examination, and/or examination under anaesthesia (EUA)

A fundamental part of the management of obstetric fistula is the ap- propriate standard management of ALL women who have survived prolonged or obstructed labour, since it can prevent fistula formation and cure small ones.

Aims of management are to:
 Prevent fistula formation Close the fistula Make the woman continent and able to resume a full and active life Principles of immediate care of women who have survived prolonged/ obstructed labour, or who present immediately after delivery with obstetric fistula

## Chapter 16: Obstetric Conditions

# 16.7 Intrauterine Fetal Demise (Iufd) Or Fetal Death In Utero (Fdiu)

## Fistula Prevention

Fetal demise (fetal death) refers to situations in which the fetus is no longer alive, but the uterus has not yet started to expel its contents and the cervical os remains closed. Intrauterine fetal demise or death refers to babies with no signs of life in utero. "early IUFD" refers to fetal demise before 20 weeks' gestation and IUFD for demise of a fetus at 20 weeks gestation through to term.

Causes
~ Birth defects (congenital abnormalities of the fetus)
~ Blood transfer from baby to mother (feto-maternal hemorrhage)
~ Maternal or fetal infection
~ Genetic abnormality of the fetus
~ Placenta separated from the inner uterine wall (placental abruption)
~ Umbilical cord issues
~ Uterine rupture Prevention: 
This should be done during antenatal and intrapartum to reduce fetal death
~ Detection and treatment of syphilis/ Malaria
~ Detection and management of hypertensive disease of pregnancy
~ Management of sickle cell disease
~ Detection and management of diabetes
~ Monitoring during labour CHAPTER 16: **Obstetric Conditions**
Diagnosis: 
 vaginal bleeding Absence or cessation of fetal movements—the usual reason for consultation.

 A uterus that is significantly smaller than the expected size i.e., 
fundal height too small for gestational age or decrease in fundal height from a prior visit.

 Absence of fetal heart sounds on electronic auscultation Sometimes, breast engorgement, indicating the end of the pregnancy.

 The above signs suggest fetal death but are not sufficiently sensitive to justify a hasty, rash decision. Errors are common. Repeat the exam, do not rush.

 Ultrasonography paired with indicative clinical findings is essential for the accurate diagnosis/ confirmation of Intra-uterine Fetal Death (IUFD) 
Common etiologies of IUFD <28weeks gestation: 
 Infection or other medical conditions Placental abruption or insufficiency/Intrauterine growth restriction Congenital malformations of the fetus Umbilical cord accidents or other complications Medical management of IUFD (≥ 14 to ≤ **28 weeks)**
 IUFD may be managed expectantly or treated surgically (D&E) 
or medically (with medications).

 Discussions aim to foster shared decision making about the plan for care and support maternal/parental choice. 

 Supportive social and psychological care should be made available to all bereaved parents a combination of mifepristone and misoprostol should be the first-line intervention:
- Mifepristone (200mg) administered orally followed 1–2 days later by repeat doses of 400 μg misoprostol administered sublingually or vaginally every 4–6 hours. The minimum recommended interval between use of mifepristone and misoprostol is 24 hours. Between 24 and 48 hours of mifepristone (200mg), the four tablets of misoprostol should be given vaginally, sublingually and can be administered by physician, midwife or woman herself.

- Alternative regimens: repeat doses of 400 μg misoprostol administered sublingually or vaginally every 4–6 hours. However, research shows that the combination regimen, above is more effective than misoprostol alone.

 Expectant Management of IUFD involves awaiting spontaneous labour (may take up to 3 weeks). 

 Recommendations about labour and birth should take into account the mother's preferences, her medical condition and previous intra-partum history.

 Vaginal birth is the recommended mode of delivery for most women, but caesarean birth may need to be considered in individual cases. 

 Pregnancy tissue should be treated in the same way as other biological material unless the individual expresses a desire for it to be managed otherwise.

 If a woman has had a previous caesarean section, a discussion as to the safety and benefits of induction of labour needs to be undertaken by a consultant obstetrician.

 Clinical assessment and evaluation are recommended to assess maternal wellbeing and to determine the cause of death, the chance of recurrence, and of avoiding future pregnancy complications.

 Laboratory tests are recommended to rule out any maternal disease or risk factor that may have contributed to the IUFD 
 Fetal karyotyping should be considered in all cases.

 Parents should be offered a full postmortem examination of the baby.

 Postmortem examination should include external examination with birth weight, histology of relevant tissues and plain radiography (skeletal survey)
 Pathological examination of the cord, membranes and placenta is recommended in all cases of IUFD 
 Standardized checklists should be used to ensure that all appropriate care options are offered and that each response mark is recorded.

 A standardized dataset should be collected for all IUFDs. All IUFDs should be reviewed in a multi-professional meeting using a standardized approach.

 All term intra-partum deaths with no evidence of a major congenital anomaly should be investigated locally.

 Staff working with bereaved parents should be provided with an opportunity to develop their knowledge and understanding of perinatal loss, together with the development of skills in working in this area.

 A system should be in place to give clinical and psychological support to staff involved with an IUFD.

 A follow-up appointment with the consultant obstetrician should be arranged and it should be clear who is responsible for making these arrangements.

 Women with a history of IUFD should attend a consultant-led hospital-based antenatal clinic in their next pregnancy and undergo increased antenatal surveillance.

## Note

Medical management of IUFD with mifepristone and misoprostol combined is contraindicated in any person with a known allergy to either medication, ectopic pregnancy, chronic adrenal failure, or inherited porphyria, and used with caution in women with life-threatening un-stabilized conditions such as uncontrolled cardiac disease, severe anemia, or hemorrhagic disorders, uncontrolled serious asthma or in those with an IUD in place.

Medical management of induced abortion Medical management of induced abortion (for both viable and non-viable pregnancies) at early or later gestational ages involves the use of a single-drug regimen or a combination regimen of medicines used in sequence, with specific dosages and routes of administration. 

In Uganda, the following categories of people who can get services for termination of pregnancy: 
 severe maternal illnesses threatening the health of a pregnant woman e.g. severe cardiac disease, renal disease, severe pre-eclampsia and eclampsia; severe foetal abnormalities which are not compatible with extra-uterine life e.g. molar pregnancy, anencephaly; cancer cervix. 

 HIV-positive women requesting for a termination. 

 Rape, incest, and defilement.

 HC IV
 general hospital, and referral hospital levels. By a medical officer, or gynae/surgeon Management For medical management of induced abortion at gestation ages 
< **12 weeks:** 
 Two-medication regimen: First, the use of 200 mg mifepristone is administered orally, followed 1–2 days later by 800 μg of misoprostol administered vaginally, sublingually, or buccally. The minimum recommended interval between use of mifepristone and misoprostol is 24 hours. These medications can be taken by the person herself, or administered on an outpatient basis by trained health workers. 

 Single-medication regimen: 800 μg misoprostol administered buccally, sublingually, or vaginally.

Evidence from clinical studies demonstrates that the combination regimen is more effective than misoprostol alone.

For either regimen:
 Repeat doses of misoprostol can be considered when needed to achieve success of the abortion process. In this guideline we do not provide a maximum number of doses of misoprostol.

 All routes are included as options for misoprostol administration, in consideration of patient and provider preference Medical management of induced abortion at gestational ages ≥ **12 weeks**
 Two-medication regimen: 200 mg mifepristone is administered orally, followed 1–2 days later by repeat doses of 400 μg misoprostol administered buccally, sublingually or vaginally every 3 hours.* The minimum recommended interval between use of mifepristone and misoprostol is 24 hours. 

 Single-medication regimen: When using misoprostol alone: 
recommend the use of repeat doses of 400 μg misoprostol administered vaginally, sublingually or buccally every 3 hours.

CHAPTER 16: **Obstetric Conditions**

![101_image_2.png](101_image_2.png)

## Pain Management

Should be proactive for medical management of induced abortion at any gestational age. Pain medication should be offered routinely (e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]). It should be provided for the individual to use if and when wanted. Acetominophen can be used for pain control when NSAIDS are unavailable. Other methods of pain control, such as certain anti-emetics and epidural anaesthesia can be considered as necessary, with the goal of proactive, patient-centered pain management.

## Precaution

![101_Image_0.Png](101_Image_0.Png)

 Ectopic pregnancy should be excluded, and intra-uterine

gestation confirmed before the medical abortion. The medical abortion regimen will not terminate the ectopic pregnancy Fertility can return within two weeks therefore all patients should be given post-abortion contraception where eligible Access to appropriate medical care must be assured in case an emergency develops; the patient should be given clear verbal and written instructions on whom she should contact and where to go in case of concerns or suspected complications

IMNCI (Integrated Management of Newborn and Childhood Illnesses)
The following guidelines use a syndromic approach to the management of common childhood conditions at Primary Health Care Level and should be followed page-by-page.

The general approach used involves 5 main steps:
- Assess the child - Classify the illness - Identify and provide the required treatment - Counsel the mother - Provide FOLLOW UP support There are 3 sections, based on age:
- Sick newborn (1st week of life) - Sick infant (up to 2 months) - Sick child (2 months to 5 years)

- If no, ask the mother to put the infant to the breast. - If yes, ask the mother if she can wait and tell you when the infant is willing to feed again
~ Observe breastfeeding for 4 minutes: is the infant able to attach properly to the breast? For good attachment, the following should be present:
- Chin touching breast - Mouth wide open - Lower lip turned outwards - More areola visible above than below the mouth
~ Is the infant able to suckle effectively? This means slow, deep sucks with occasional pauses
- Clear a blocked nose if it interferes with breastfeeding

~ Warmth: Ensure the young infant is always warm
~ Check if this is an initial or FOLLOW UP
- If FOLLOW UP visit: Check up on previous problems, check that the treatment has been given correctly and assess any new problems
~ If initial visit: Continue as below In assessing a sick child, assess for the following:
- General danger signs: URGENT ATTENTION and ACTION REQUIRED.

Then check for:
- Cough or difficult breathing - Diarrhoea and dehydration - Fever - Ear problems - Malnutrition and feeding problems - Anaemia - HIV - Immunization, deworming and vitamin A - Any other problem Then counsel the mother on
- Extra fluids for any sick child - Nutrition and breastfeeding of the child - How to give home treatments - Her own health needs - To return for FOLLOW UP as scheduled To return immediately if any danger sign appear

## 17.4 Integrated Community Case Management

Integrated Community Case Management (iCCM) of malaria, pneumonia and diarrhoea is a recently adopted strategy for the treatment of common childhood illness at community level by trained Community Health Workers since 2010. It addresses a gap in delivery of curative services to children below 5 years allowing:
 prompt and accessible treatment of uncomplicated malaria, pneumonia and diarrhoea identification of danger signs (convulsions, chest indrawing, unable to feed, vomiting everything, lethargy/ unconsciousness) and pre-referral treatment monitoring of newborns during the first week of life, counselling and referral if any problem identified.

Community health workers work in close collaboration with the health unit, to which they report and refer cases and from which they receive supplies and supervision.

Supplies provided to trained community health workers ICCM commodities
~ Respiratory timers and Amoxicillin dispersible tablets for diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia
~ ORS sachets and Zinc tablets for treatment of diarrhoea
~ RDTs and ACTs for diagnosis and treatment of uncomplicated malaria
~ Rectal artesunate for pre referral treatment of complicated malaria.

~ Examination gloves
~ Dispensing envelopes
~ Registers, referral notes and sick job aids Other commodities for community health workers
~ Other preventive treatments: used in prevention and treatment of common conditions and neglected topical diseases like albendazole, azithromycin syrup and tablets, ivermectin, tetracycline eye ointment, praziquantel, COC.

## 17.5 Child Growth Weight Standards Charts

The WHO Child Growth Standards charts are used to identify normal growth for children under 5 years, as well as growth problems or trends that suggest that a child is at risk of a problem.

## Weight-For-Age

r Used to show if a child is normal weight or underweight for their age. It should not be used to assess obesity and overweight.

## Disadvantages

- If a child's age is unknown, it is of limited use - It cannot distinguish between chronic malnutrition (stunting) and acute malnutrition
- Also, if a child has oedema of both feet, fluid retention increases the child's weight, masking what may actually be very low weight.

## Weight For-Height/Length

r Used to diagnose acute malnutrition r The cut-off for severe acute malnutrition is -3 z-scores and below. These children are at a high risk of mortality, but respond quickly and safely to re-feeding using therapeutic foods following recommended guidelines.

r The cut-off for moderate acute malnutrition is -2 to -3 z-scores below.

 
CHAPTER 17: **Childhood Illness**
Mean Upper Arm circumference (MUAC)
r Used to diagnose acute malnutrition r The cut off for severe acute malnutrition is 115 mm (11.5 cm) 
and below.

General principles of routine childhood immunization
~ The aim is to ensure that all target age groups complete their immunization schedule as above
~ Age for vaccinations: Give each vaccine at the recommended age or if this is not possible, at any first contact with the child after this age
~ BCG vaccination
- Give this as early as possible in life, preferably at birth - Do NOT give BCG vaccine to any child with clinical signs and symptoms of immunosuppression, e.g. AIDS
~ Use each vaccine with its corresponding pre-cooled diluent from the same manufacturer
~ Polio vaccination (= 'birth dose'): This is a primer dose of oral polio vaccine (OPV), which should be given ideally at birth but otherwise in the first 2 weeks of life
~ DPT-HepB-Hib vaccine
- Is a combination of DPT vaccine + hepatitis B vaccine (HepB) 
+ haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine
- Minimum interval between each of the doses is 4 weeks
~ Measles rubella vaccination Given at 9 and 18 months of age or first contact after this age Can also be given to any unimmunised child of 6-9 months old who has been exposed to measles patients. Children vaccinated in this way must have the vaccination repeated at 9 months of age
~ Vaccination of sick children Admit and treat any child who is severely ill, and vaccinate at the time of discharge Minor illness is not a contraindication to vaccination Screen clients at points of care and administer the due vaccines Screen clients for vaccine preventable diseases for investigation and notification Administration and storage of vaccines Storage and transport
~ At health units, vaccines should be stored between +2°C to
~ +8°C
~ At the district and central vaccine stores (static units) where freezers exist, polio and measles rubella vaccines may be stored for prolonged periods at -20°C
~ Do not freeze DPT-HepB-Hib, PCV, IPV, HPV, hepatitis B, 
yellow fever and TT vaccines
~ Never freeze the diluents for BCG,yellow fever and measles vaccines CHAPTER 17: **Childhood Illness**
~ Use conditioned ice packs and sponge method for transport Carefully follow recommended procedures to maintain the cold chain for all vaccines, e.g.:
 Ensure continuous supply of power/gas Record fridge temperature twice daily (morning and evening, including weekends/public holidays)
 Use sponge method during each immunization session Reconstitution and administration
~ Never use the diluents provided for vaccines to mix other injectable medicines
~ Never use water for injection as a diluent for vaccine reconstitution Do not vaccinate in direct sunlight (always carry out immunization in a building or under a shade)
~ Record every vaccination in the child register and on a tally sheet until child has completed all the antigens
~ Use the child register and child health card for tracking drop outs
~ A child who received any immunization dose during national immunization campaigns should still get the routine vaccination doses
~ Never use any vaccine:
- After its expiry date - When the vaccine vial monitor (VVM) has changed to discard point (stage 3 and 4)
- If there has been contamination, or contamination is - suspected in open vials - If the vial labels are lost - DPT-HepB-Hib, HebB, PCV,rotavirus vaccine, IPV, HPV, 
TT/Td that have been frozen Adhere to the WHO recommended Multi-Dose Vial Policy (MDVP) as below:

## Chapter 17: Childhood Illness Other Vaccinations 18.1.2 Hepatitis B Vaccination

~ Since 2005, children are immunised against Hepatitis B in the routine childhood immunization using the DPT-HepBHib vaccine at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age 878 
~ For adolescents and adults, it is recommended that the hepatitis B vaccination is given preferably after testing for hepatitis B infection (HBsAg and Anti-HBs). Patients with HIV and pregnant women should be handled on a case by case basis
~ Vaccination is recommended for high risk groups, e.g:

Nutrition is the intake of food, considered in relation to the body's dietary needs. Good nutrition - an adequate, well balanced diet combined with regular physical activity - is a cornerstone of good health.

Poor nutrition can lead to reduced immunity, increased susceptibility to disease, impaired physical and mental development, and reduced productivity.

Optimal nutrition means obtaining a balance of macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins and fats) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals).

Macronutrients provide energy for organ and tissue functions and growth, and micronutrients are needed in small amounts for chemical processes in the body such as metabolism, growth, and protection against infections.

In addition, plenty of water is needed to build cells and regulate body processes.

## 19.1 Nutrition Guidelines In Special Populations 19.1.1 Infant And Young Child Feeding (Iycf)

1. Counsel and support all mothers to initiate breastfeeding within an hour of delivery and exclusively breastfeed their infants for the first six months of life, unless medically contraindicated.

2. Teach mother correct positioning and attachment for breastfeeding, how to express and store breast milk hygienically, and how to feed the child by a cup.

3. Counsel and support parents to introduce adequate, safe, and ap- propriate complementary foods at 6 months of age, and to continue breast feeding until the child is 2 years.

4. A good diet should be adequate in quantity and include an energy-rich food (e.g. thick cereal with added oil, meat, fish, eggs, legumes, fruits and vegetables)
5. Pregnant women and lactating mothers should consume adequate nutritious foods 6. Recommend exclusive breastfeeding for infants of HIV-infected women for the first 6 months unless the replacement is acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable, and safe (AFASS).

7. Malnourished children should be provided with appropriate medical care, nutritional rehabilitation, and follow-up.

8. Encourage mothers of low birth weight infants who can suckle to breastfeed. Assist those who cannot breastfeed to express breast milk and feed the baby.

9. During illness, children should take increased fluids: breastfeed more often, increase amount of milk given, increase fluid intake (e.g. soups, yoghurt, and drinking water). Extra fluid in diarrhoea is especially life-saving 10. For more information on feeding recommendations in infants and young children, see IMCI section 17.3.12.3
 

## 19.1.2 Nutrition In Hiv/Aids

Good nutrition in HIV/AIDS is important as it helps to:
~ Prevent malnutrition and wasting
~ Delay the progress of HIV to AIDS
~ Enhance the body's ability to fight opportunistic infections
~ Achieve and maintain optimal body weight and strength Relieve complications, e.g., diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, thrush
~ Improve effectiveness and tolerance of medication ~ Improve quality of life Severe malnutrition is diagnosed when:
~ BMI <16 kg/m2
~ Weight loss >10% in past 2 months ~ MUAC <185 mm (<210 mm if pregnant or postpartum)
~ Persistent diarrhoea or fever

| TREATMENT   | LOC HC4  HC3   |
|-------------|----------------|
| If patient has other complications ‰ Admit patient and treat infections and rehydrate If patient has no other medical complications ‰ Treat as an outpatient ‰ Promote weight gain with high-energy foods, protein,  vitamins and minerals ‰ If ready-to-use therapeutic food is available, give 3 sa- chets Supplement the patient's diet with multivitamins  and minerals, 1-2 tablets per day e.g, a combination of  selenium and molinga has been proven to be beneficial  per day in adults, in addition to normal food - See next section 19.2 for malnutrition in children ‰ Follow up in 2 weeks, at 1 month, then every 2 months  thereafter             |                |

CHAPTER 18: **Immunization**

## 19.1.3 Nutrition In Diabetes

People with diabetes should follow normal nutritional guidelines for the general population, and can eat the same foods as the whole family since everyone benefits from healthy eating.

Healthy eating and exercise in diabetics help to:
 Maintain the blood glucose close to normal to prevent complications Control cholesterol levels Control blood pressure, and reduce the risk of complications such as heart disease and stroke In addition, diabetics have to take care to balance their food with insulin and oral antidiabetic medications to help manage their blood glucose levels. Healthy diet involves eating a variety of foods including vegetables, whole grains, fruits, non-fat dairy products, beans, lean meat, poultry, and fish. These are rich in vitamins, minerals and fibre. Avoid processed foods.

## General Advice

~ Eat three meals a day. Avoid skipping meals, and space out breakfast, lunch, and evening meal over the day
~ At each meal, include moderate amount (around 1/3 of the plate) of starchy carbohydrate foods, e.g., bread, pasta, chapatis, potatoes, yams, noodles, rice, and cereals. Eat more slowly absorbed (low glycaemic index) foods, e.g., pasta, rice, sweet potato and yam, porridge oats, bran, and natural muesli
~ Reduce fat in the diet, especially saturated fats. Use unsaturated fats or oils e.g. olive oil, sunflower oil
~ Eat more fruit and vegetables. Aim for at least five portions a day. Eat more beans and lentils.

~ Limit sugar and sugary foods
~ Reduce salt in the diet to 6 g or less per day
~ Drink alcohol only in moderation: 1 drink (one beer or one small glass of wine or one shot of spirit) for women and 2 for men as a maximum amount daily. Alcohol has some cardioprotective effect. It should be consumed with food to prevent hypoglycaemia
~ Don't use products marketed as "diabetic foods, drinks or herbs" (they are expensive and of no benefit)
~ Routine supplementation with vitamins and minerals without underlying actual deficiency is not beneficial, patients should eat lots of fruits and vegetables e.g, a combination of selenium and molinga has been proven to be beneficial
~ Obese and overweight patients need to be encouraged to reduce weight using exercise and diet modifications

## 19.2 Malnutrition Icd10 Code: E40-43 19.2.1 Introduction On Malnutrition

Malnutrition is the cellular imbalance between the supply of nutrients and energy and the body's demand for them to ensure growth, maintenance, and specific functions. It includes both under- and over nutrition.

However, the term "malnutrition" commonly refers to undernutrition, and is used as such in these guidelines.

Although malnutrition can affect all ages, however, the early stages, including, foetus, infants and children, are most vulnerable to the effects of undernutrition during the period of their most rapid physical growth and development during the first two years of life.

Malnutrition is a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality among children under 5 years in Uganda. It also makes the prognosis of other diseases poor.

## Note

 Previously, malnutrition was classified into two types: 1) ProteinEnergy Malnutrition (PEM) due to lack of adequate protein and energy in the diet and 2) Micronutrient malnutrition-due to deficiencies in specific micronutrients (vitamins and minerals).

 These causal names are now avoided because protein and energy deficits are likely to be accompanied by deficiencies of other nutrients, and management of malnutrition takes this into consideration.

 
Causes/contributing factors to malnutrition
~ Immediate causes: diet and disease Inadequate quantity and quality of food Lack of knowledge on appropriate foods provided to children, poor food preparation, food taboos Infections: reduce appetite, increase energy and nutrient utilisation, and limit the ability to absorb or retain nutrients e.g. in diarrhoea, intestinal parasites
~ Root causes: food insecurity, poor health services, poor environmental sanitation, natural disasters, excessive workload for women, poor weaning practices, culture, inadequate water supply, low literacy levels, low nutrition advocacy/education
~ Underlying causes: poverty, corruption, poor governance, poor infrastructure.

## Consequences Of Malnutrition

~ Impaired growth, physical and mental and development
~ Impaired body resistance/immune system
~ Increased risk of adult chronic diseases
~ Increased risk of mortality
~ Increased risk for the cycle of inter-generational malnutrition
~ Poor economic well-being for the individual and country Differential diagnosis
~ Nephrotic syndrome (nephritis)
~ Liver disease ~ Heart disease
~ Malabsorption syndrome
~ Malignancy (e.g., gastrointestinal tract cancer, liver cancer/hepatocellular carcinoma)

## 19.2.1.1 Classification Of Malnutrition

| TYPE    | DEFINITION OR FEATURES                                                                                                                                               |    |

| ~       | Most appropriate indicator to use in an  emergency setting (e.g. due to sudden/ sharp period of food shortage)                                                       |    |
| ~       | Associated with loss of body fat and severe  wasting                                                                                                                 |    |
| ~       | Children are thinner than their comparable  age group of same height                                                                                                 |    |
| ~       | Classified as Moderate or Severe based on  anthropometry (measurement of the size,  weight and proportions of the human body),  biochemistry and clinical assessment |    |
| Chronic | ~                                                                                                                                                                    | Is an indicator of the nutritional status overtime; chronically malnourished children are  shorter (stunted) than their comparable age  group    |

## Clinical Features Of Malnutrition

~ Marasmus: severe wasting, old man's face, excess skin' hangs around the buttocks, ribs and zygoma bones are prominent, scapular blades and extremities (limbs), eyes are sunken
- Apathetic or irritable, appetite is fairly good, skin is almost normal, hair demonstrates some changes but not as dramatic as in Kwashiorkor, organomegaly is rare (liver and spleen enlargement)
~ Kwashiakor: pitting feet oedema, skin desquamation, hair changes, presence of bilateral pitting oedema (oedema of both feet), moon face Appears adequately nourished due to excess extra cellular fluid, but is very miserable, apathetic Skin changes (dermatosis, flacky paint dermatitis)
 Hair changes: Silky, straight, sparsely distributed; easily, painlessly pluckable Severe pallor of the conjunctiva, mucous membranes, palms, and soles, loss of skin turgor (dehydration)
 Organomegaly (liver, spleen) is common
~ Marasmus-kwashiakor: most common form, presents with features of both Marasmus and Kwashiorkor

## 19.2.1.2 Assessing Malnutrition In Children 6 Months To 5 Years

The 4 key features used to diagnose acute malnutrition are:
 Weight-for-Height/Length (WFH/L) using WHO growth standards charts (see section 15.5). It is the best indicator for diagnosing acute malnutrition.

 Mean Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) in mm using a measuring tape (see section 17.5)
 Oedema of both feet (kwashiorkor with or without severe wasting)
 Appetite test: ability to finish portion of ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF).

WEIGHT FOR AGE (WFA) reflects both long term (stunting) and short term (wasting) nutritional status, so it is not very useful for diagnosis of acute malnutrition. It can also miss out oedematous children, who are very malnourished but may have a near-normal weight because of fluid retention.

CHAPTER 18: **Immunization**
Children with SAM should always be first assessed with a full clinical examination to confirm presence of any danger sign, medical com- plications, and tested for appetite.

 Assess patient's history of:
 Recent intake of food, loss of appetite, breastfeeding Usual diet before current illness (compare the answers to the Feeding Recommendations for the Child's age (section 17.3.12.3)
 Duration, frequency and type of diarrhoea and vomiting Family circumstances Cough >2 weeks and contact with TB
 Contact with measles Known or suspected HIV infection/exposure Initial examination for danger signs and medical complications:
 Shock: lethargy or unconscious, cold hands, slow capillary refill (<3 seconds), weak pulse, low blood pressure Signs of dehydration Severe palmar pallor Bilateral pitting oedema Eye signs of vitamin A deficiency: dry conjunctiva, corneal ulceration, keratomalacia, photophobia Local signs of infection: ear, throat, skin, pneumonia Signs of HIV (see WHO Clinical Staging section 3.1.1)
 Fever (³37.5°C) or hypothermia (rectal temp <35.5°C)
 Mouth ulcers Skin changes of kwashiorkor: hypo- or hyperpigmentation, desquamation, ulcerations all over the body, exudative lesions (resembling burns) with secondary infection (including candida)
 Laboratory tests Blood glucose
- Complete blood count or Hb, malaria, HIV, electrolytes - Stool microscopy for ova and cysts, occult blood, and parasites Chest X-ray: Look for evidence of tuberculosis or other chest abnormalities Conduct an appetite test
- Assess all children ³6 months for appetite at the initial visit and at every follow up visit to the health facility

## How To Do Appetite Test

~ Arrange a quiet corner where the child and mother can take their time to eat RUTF. Usually the child eats the RUTF portion within 30 minutes Explain to the mother
~ The purpose of assessing the child's appetite
~ What RUTF is ~ How to give RUTF
- Wash hands before giving RUTF - Sit with child and gently offer RUTF - Encourage child to eat without feeding by force - Offer plenty of water to drink from a cup during RUTF feeding Offer appropriate amount of RUTF to child to eat:
~ After 30 minutes, check if the child was able to finish or not able to finish the amount of RUTF given and decide:
- Child ABLE to finish at least one third of a packet of RUTF portion 
(92 g) or 3 teaspoons from a pot within 30 minutes
- Child NOT ABLE to eat one-third of a packet of RUTF portion (92 g) 
or 3 teaspoons from a pot within 30 minutes Determine WFH/L: Measure the child's height and weight and plot the score on the appropriate chart (boy or girl). Match the value to the z-score on the right y-axis to determine the child's z-score (see section 17.5)
 Measure MUAC: Using a MUAC tape, measure the circumference of the child's upper arm and plot the score on the appropriate chart (boy or girl, section 17.5). Please note: 1 cm=10 mm, so 11.5 cm = 115 mm.

## 19.2.2 Management Of Acute Malnutrition In Children General Principles Of Management

~ Admit all children with any danger sign, medical complications, pitting oedema or those who fail appetite tests for inpatient care and treatment for complicated SAM.

 Keep them in a warm area separated from infectious children, or in a special nutrition area.

~ Children with good appetite and no medical complications can be managed as outpatients for uncomplicated SAM.

~ Adequate facilities and staff to ensure correct preparation of therapeutic foods, and to feed child regularly day and night, should be available.

~ Accurate weighing machines and MUAC tapes should be available
~ Proper records of feeds given and child's measurements should be kept so that progress can be monitored
~ Explain to patient/care-giver to handle the child gently

CHAPTER 19: **Nutrition**
 Counsel the mother and encourage her to continue with appropriate RUTF feeding. Ask mother to return again in 14 days If the child has moderate acute malnutrition:
 Advise the mother to continue RUTF. Counsel her to start other foods according to the age appropriate feeding recommendations (see section 17.3.12.3)
 Tell her to return in 14 days. Continue to see the child every 14 days until the child has no more acute malnutrition If the child has no acute malnutrition (WFH/L is -2 z-scores or more, or MUAC is 125 mm or more) 
 Praise the mother, STOP RUTF and counsel her about age appropriate feeding recommendations

## 19.2.2.3 Management Of Complicated Severe Acute Malnutrition

In-patient care
~ Refer child to hospital: prevent hypoglycaemia by giving small sips of sugar water, keep the child warm, first dose of antibiotics (ampicillin + gentamicin)
~ Triage the children to fast-track seriously ill patients for assessment and care: treat shock, hypoglycaemia, and corneal ulceration, immediately
~ General treatment involves 10 steps in two phases: initial stabilisation for 1 week and rehabilitation (for weeks 2-6) as in the table below

Note Iron is given after 2 days on F-100; if patient is taking RUTF, 
do NOT give iron Management of Complications in SAM Hypoglycaemia (Blood sugar <3 mmol/L or <54 mg/dL)
~ All severly malnourished children are at a risk of hypo- glycaemia, and should be given a feed or 10% glucose or sucrose, immediately on admission
~ Frequent 2 hour feeding is important TREATMENT
Immediately on admission Give 50 ml of glucose or sugar water (one rounded teaspoon of sugar in 3 tablespoons of water) orally or by NGT, followed by first feed as soon as possible If child is able to drink
~ Give first feed of F-75 therapeutic milk, if available, ev- ery 30 minutes for 2 hours, then continue with feeds every 2 hours for 24 hours
- Then give feeds every 2 or 3 hours, day and night **If child is unconscious**
 Treat with IV 10% glucose at 5 ml/kg If IV access cannot be quickly established, give 10% glucose or sucrose solution by NGT tube. To make 10% solution, dilute 1 part of 50% glucose with 4 parts of water OR 1 part of glucose 50% with 9 parts of glucose 5%

- If IV glucose not available, give 1 teaspoon of sugar moistened with 1-2 drops of water sublingually, and repeat every 20 minutes to prevent relapse
- Monitor children for early swallowing which delays - absorption; if it happens, give another dose of sugar - Start on appropriate IV/IM antibiotics

If initial blood glucose was low, repeat measurement after 30 minutes If blood glucose falls to <3 mmol/L (<54 mg/dL), repeat the 10% glucose or oral sugar solution, and ensure antibiotics have been given
- If it is higher, change to 3 hourly feeds of F-75 If rectal tempearture falls to <35.5°C, or if level of consciousness deteriorates, repeat the blood glucose measurement and treat accordingly Prevention Feed every 2 hours, starting immediately (see below), or if child is dehydrated, rehydrate first. Continue feeding throught the night Encourage mothers to watch for any deterioration, help feed and keep the child warm Check on abdominal distension Hypothermia (Axillary temperature <35°C and rectal temperature <35.5°C)
~ Often associated with hypoglycaemia or serious infection

 Feed child immediately as in hypoglycaemia above Warm the child: make sure the child is well covered, especially the head, with cloths, hats, and blankets
- If available, use a heater but not pointing directly at the child. DO NOT use hot water bottles or flourescent lamps Encourage caretaker/mother to sleep next to her child and kangaroo technique for infants (skin-to-skin contact, direct heat/ warmth transfer from mother to child)

 Keep the ward closed during the night and avoid wind drafts inside Give appropriate IV or IM antibiotics Change wet nappies, clothes and bedding to keep child and bed dry Quickly clean the patient with a warm wet towel and dry imme- diately. Avoid washing the baby directly in the first few weeks of admission

 Take child's rectal temperature every 2 hours until it rises to <36.5°C, If using a heater, take it every 30 minutes Cover the child at all times, especially at night. Keep head cov- ered with hat to prevent heat loss Check for hypoglycaemia Dehydration
~ In both oedema and non-oedematous SAM, the margin of safety between dehydration and over-hydration is very narrow. Exercise care and caution to avoid over-hydration and risk of cardiac failure Assume that all children with watery diarrhoea or reduced urine output have some dehydration

 Do NOT use IV route for rehydration, except in cases of shock Rehydrate slowly, either orally or by NGT using ReSoMal, a specially prepared rehydration solution for malnutrition, The standard ORS has a high sodium and low potassium content, which is not suitable for SAM, except if profuse diarrhoea is present
~ Give ReSoMal more slowly than you would when rehydrating a well-nourished child
- Give 5 ml/kg every 30 minutes for the first 2 hours

![15_image_1.png](15_image_1.png) - Then give 5-10 ml/kg per hour for the next 4-10 hours, with F-75 formula. Exact amount depends on how much the child wants, the volume of stool loss and whether the child is vomiting If ReSoMal not available:
- Give half strength standard ORS, with added potassium and glucose as

|    | -   | Instead of ReSoMal, at the same times. Give the same volume of  starter F-75 as of ReSoMal |
| If child is unconscious, in shock or severe dehydration ‰ Give IV fluid Darrow's solution or Ringer's lactate and 5% glucose (or if not available, ½ saline and 5% glucose at 15 mL/kg the first hour and reassess - If improving, give 15 mL/kg in second hour - If conscious, give NGT ReSoMal - If not improving, treat for septic shock Monitoring ~ ONLY rehydrate until the weight deficit is corrected and then  STOP, DO NOT give extra fluid to "prevent recurrence" (from  specialist's notes) ~ During rehydration, respiration and pulse rate should fall and  urine passing should start ~ Return of tears, moist mouth, improved skin tugor and less sunken eyes and fontanelle are a sign of rehydration. SAM children  will not show these and so weight gain should be measured ~ Monitor progress of rehydration every 30 minutes for 2 hours,  then every hour for the next 4-10 hours Be alert for signs of overhydration, which is dangerous and can lead to  heart failure. Check for: - Weight gain (make sure it is not quick or excessive) - If increase in pulse rate by 25/minute, respiratory rate by 5/minute is  present, stop ReSoMal. Reassess after 1 hour - Urine frequency (if child urinated since last check) - Enlarging liver size on palpation - Frequency of stools and vomit Prevention ‰ Same as in dehydration in well-nourished child, except that ReSoMal is used  instead of standard ORS. Give 30-50 ml of ReSoMal (for child <2 years) and 100  ml (for child ³2 years) after each watery stool. - Small, frequent, unformed stools are common in SAM and should  not be confused with profuse watery stools, and they do not require  treatment    |     |                                                                                            |

## Electrolyte Imbalance

~ All SAM children have deficiencies of potassium and magnesium, which may take up to 2 weeks to correct
~ Oedema is partly due to potassium deficiency and sodium retention Do not treat oedema with diuretics Giving high sodium doses could kill the child

 Give extra potassium (3-4 mmol/kg per day) f Give extra mag- nesium (0.4-0.6 mmol/kg per day) f Add extra potassium and magnesium to the feeds. If not already pre-mixed, add 20 ml of the combined electrolyte/mineral solution to 1 litre of feed, or use pre- mixed sachets for SAM
 Use ReSoMal to rehydrate Prepare food without added salt

## Infections

~ In SAM, usual signs of bacterial infection, e.g. fever, are usually absent, yet multiple infections are common.

~ Assume all SAM cases have an infection, and treat with CHAPTER 19: **Nutrition**
antibiotics immediately. Hypoglycaemia and hypothermia are often signs of severe infection

Broad spectrum antibiotics Benzylpenicillin 50,000 IU/kg IM or IV every 6 hours Or ampi- cillin 50 mg/kg every 6 hours for 2 days f Then, oral amoxicillin 25-40 mg/kg every 8 hours for 5 days PLUS
 Gentamicin 7.5 mg/kg once a day for 7 days Measles vaccination If child is ³ 6 months and not vaccinated, or was vaccinated before 9 months of age. Delay vaccination if child is in shock Other specific infections Treat other specific infections if diagnosed as appropriate, e.g., 
malaria, pneumonia, dysentery, soft- tissue infections, mengin- gitis, TB, HIV
 If parasitic worms are diagnosed, delay treatment until the re- habilitation phase. Give albendazole 200-400 mg single dose
- In endemic areas, give mebendazole orally twice a day - for 3 days to all SAM children 7 days after admission - If HIV diagnosed, start ART as soon as possible after stabilisation of metabolic compilcations Monitoring If child is still anorexic after 7 days of antibiotic treatment, continue for a full 10-day course. If anorexia persists, reassess child fully

## Micronutrient Deficiencies

~ All SAM children have vitamin and mineral deficiencies
~ Anaemia is common, but DO NOT give iron initially, instead wait until the child has a good appetite and has started gaining weight, usually in the second week, because iron can make infections worse
~ RUTF already contains adequate iron so do not add. F-100 does not contain iron, so iron supplements are needed
 
 
CHAPTER 19: **Nutrition**
~ F-75, F-100 and RUTF already contain multivitamins (including vitamin A and folic acid) zinc and copper. Additional doses are not needed
~ If there are no eye signs or history of measles, then do not give a high dose of vitamin A as therapeutic foods already contain adequate amounts

TREATMENT
ONLY IF child has signs of vitamin A deficiency like corneal ulceration or history of measles Give Vitamin A on day 1, and repeat on days 2 and 14 Child <6 months: 50,000 IU Child 6-12 months: 100,000 IU Child >12 months: 200,000 IU
Note: If a first dose was given in the referring centre, treat on days 1 and 14 only Iron Give iron in the second week of nutritional rehabilitation
- Do not give in the stabilization phase - Do not give in children receiving RUTF
 Start iron at 3 mg/kg per day after 2 days on F-100 catch- up formula If child is not on any pre-mixed therapeutic foods, give the following micronutrients daily for at least 2 weeks Folic acid at 5 mg on day 1; then 1 mg daily Multivitamin syrup 5 ml Zinc 2 mg/kg per day Copper at 0.3 mg/kg per day Other vitamins and minerals e.g, a combination of selenium and moringa has been proven to be beneficial Initial Re-Feeding during Stabilisation Phase In the initial phase, feeding should be gradual. The essential features of initial feeding are:
~ Frequent (every 2-3 hours) oral small feeds of low osmolality and low lactose. Never leave the child alone or forcefeed the child, as this can cause aspiration pneumonia
~ Nasogastric tube feeding if the child is eating £ 80% of the amount offered at two consecutive feeds
~ Calories at 100 kcal/kg per day (do not exceed) ~ Protein at 1-1.5 g/kg per day
~ Liquid at 130 ml/kg per day or 100 ml/kg per day if child has severe oedema
~ Milk-based formulas, such as F-75 (with 75 kcal and 0.9 g protein/100 ml), will be satisfactory for most children
- Starter F-75 formula can be commercially supplied or - locally prepared from basic ingredients - In children who get osmotic diarrhoea with commercial preparation, prepare a cereal based F75 as in the table overleaf

 If child is breastfeeding, continue breastfeeding but add the prescribed amounts of the starter formula as in the table below:

| Days   | Frequency   | Volume/ kg feed   | Volume/ kg per  day   |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| 1-2    | 2 hours     | 11 ml             | 130 ml                |
| 3-5    | 3 hours     | 16 ml             | 130 ml                |
| ³6     | 4 hours     | 22 ml             | 130 ml                |

 Feed from a cup or bowl. Use a spoon, dropper or syringe to feed very weak children Teach the mother or caregiver to help with the feeding Night feeds are essential, since long periods without a feed may lead to hypoglycaemia and death If child is vomiting, during or after a feed, estimate amount vomited and offer that amount again. If child keeps vomiting, offer half the amount of feed twice as often (e.g. every 1 hour) until vomiting stops

Monitor and record:
- Amounts of feed offered and left over - Vomiting
- Stool frequency and consistency
- Daily body weight Recipe for refeeding formula F-75 and F-100

## Transition Phase

This phase is designed to prepare the child for phase 2 or outpatient management (catch up growth).

Signs that a child is ready for transition:
~ Return of appetite
~ No episodes of hypoglycaemia (metabolically stable)
~ Reduction in or disappearance of all oedema CHAPTER 19: **Nutrition**
Make a transition from starter formula to catch-up formula, gradually over 2–3 days. DO NOT switch at once.

- Frequent feeds, unlimited amounts - 150-220 kcal/kg per day - 4-6 g of protein/kg per day Caution F-100 should never be given to take home. Transition to RUTF

 Monitor the child at least every 4 hours during transition Return child to stabilization phase if:
- Child develops loss of appetite, cannot take 80% of the feeds, develops or increased oedema, medical conditions not improving, any signs of fluid overload, significant refeeding diarrhoea Avoid causing heart failure Early signs of congestive heart failure (e.g. rapid pulse, fast breathing, basal lung crepitations, enlarging liver, gallop heart rhythm, raised jugular venous pressure If pulse is increased by 25 beats/minute and breathing rate by 5 breaths/minute, and the increase is sustained for two successive 4-hourly readings, then:
- Reduce volume fed to 100 ml/kg per day for 24 hours
~ Then gradually increase as follows:
- 115 ml/kg per day for next 24 hours - 130 ml/kg per day for the following 48 hours
~ Then, increase each feed by 10 ml as described earlier CHAPTER 19: **Nutrition**

Patient instructions on how to give RUTF
~ Wash hands before giving the RUTF
~ Sit with child on the lap and gently offer RUTF ~ Encourage child to eat RUTF without force-feeding
~ Give small, regular meals of RUTF and encourage child to eat 5-6 meals a day
~ If still breastfeeding, continue offering breast milk first before every RUTF feed
~ Give only the RUTF for 2 weeks, if breastfeeding continue to breastfeed and gradually introduce foods recommended for the age (see section 17.3.12.3)
~ When introducing recommended foods, ensure that the child completes his daily ration of RUTF before giving other foods
~ Offer plenty of clean water, to drink from a cup, when the child is eating the RUTF
 
Catch-up growth or rehabilitation phase Criteria for transfer from transition phase
~ Good appetite (child takes >80% of daily ration of RUTF)
~ Significantly reduced oedema or no oedema
~ Resolved medical complications and completed parenteral antibiotics
~ Clinically well and alert

## After The Transition Phase

Children with complicated SAM can be transferred to outpatient care during rehabilitation phase. The child will require continuing care as an outpatient to complete rehabilitation and prevent relapse.

~ Carefully assess the child and the available commuinty support
~ Refer the child for rehabilitation in outpatient care or to a community feeding programme if possible, otherwise keep the child admitted

If the child cannot be managed as outpatient (e.g. no easily accessible nutritional rehabilitation services where the child lives)
 Keep the child admitted until full discharge from nutritional program Continue with RUTF or F-100, but increase amount as the child gains weight If the child can be managed as outpatient Discharge the mother with 2-week supply of RUTF according to the table above

 Counsel caregivers on outpatient treatment and link them to a community nutritional programme if available. Ensure that mother/caregiver:
- Brings back the child for weekly supplements - Is available for child care Has received specific counselling on appropriate child feeding practices (types, amount, frequency) and basic hygiene
- Has resources to feed child (if not, give advice on available support)
Monitoring (by rate of weight gain)
~ Weigh child every morning before feeding, and plot the weight
~ Calculate and record weight gain every 3 days as g/kg per day

## For Example

Current weight of child = 6300 g Weight 3 days ago = 6000 g Weight gain in grams: 6300-6000 = 300 g Average daily weight gain = 300 g ÷ 3 days = 100 g/day Child's average weight: (6000 + 6300) ÷ 2 = 6150 g
(6.15 kg)
Divide by child's average weight in kg: 100 g/day ÷ 6.15 kg = 
16.3 g/kg per day If the weight gain is:
- Poor (<5 g/kg per day), child needs a full reassessment - Moderate (5-10 g/kg per day), check if intake targets are being met or if infection has been overlooked
- Good (>10 g/kg/day): continue rehabilitation Sensory stimulation Provide:
~ Tendor loving care
~ A cheerful, stimulating environment CHAPTER 19: **Nutrition**
 
~ Structured play therapy for 15-30 minutes/day
~ Physical activity as soon as the child is well enough
~ As much maternal involvement as possible (e.g., comforting, feeding, bathing, playing)
~ Provide suitable toys and play activities for the child

 Cover with saline soaked pads Bandage the eyes Skin lesions in kwashiorkor Usually due to zinc deficiency. The child's skin quickly improves with zinc supplementation. In addition:

 Bathe or soak affected areas for 10 minutes per day in 0.01% potassium permanganate solution

 Apply barrier cream (zinc and castor oil ointment or petroleum jelly) to the raw areas, and gentian violet or nystatin cream to skin sores Avoid using nappies so that the perinuem can stay dry

## Severe Anaemia Treatment

Severe anaemia Give blood transfusion in the first 24 hours ONLY IF:
- Hb is <4 g/dL - Hb is 4-6 g/dl, and the child has respiratory distress Use smaller volumes and slower transfusion than for a well-nour- ished child. Give:
- Whole blood, 10 ml/kg over 3 hours - Furosemide, 1 mg/kg at the start of the transfusion If child has signs of heart failure Give 10 mL/kg of packed cells, as whole blood may worsen heart failure

## Note

 Children with SAM and oedema may have redistribution of fluid leading to apparent low Hb, which does not require transfusion

~ Monitor pulse and breathing rates, listen to lung fields, examine adbomen for liver size, check jugular venous pressure every 15 minutes during transfusion
- If either breathing rate increases by 5 breaths/minute or heart rate increases by 25 beats/minute, transfuse more slowly
- If there are basal lung crepitations or an enlarging liver, stop transfusion and give IV furosemide IV at 1 mg/kg

## 19.2.2.5 Discharge From Nutritional Programme

![29_Image_1.Png](29_Image_1.Png)

Discharge children with SAM from nutritional treatment ONLY IF:
~ Weight-for-height or length is at least ³-2 z score and they have no oedema for at least 2 weeks, or
~ Mid-upper-arm circumference is ³125 mm and they have no oedema for at least 2 weeks
~ The indicator used at admission should be the same one used during follow-up. If only pitting oedema was used at diagnosis, then either WFH/L or MUAC can be used for follow-up Percentage weight gain should not be used as a criterion Feeding after discharge from nutritional programme Counsel the mother on feeding and other issues as in the table below

Feeding instructions

~ Feed child at least 5 times a day with meals that contain high 

energy and high protein content (100 kcal and 2-3 g protein per 100 g of food)

~ Give high energy snacks between meals (e.g., milk, banana, 

bread, biscuits)

~ Assist and encourage child to complete each meal

~ Give food separately to child so their intake can be checked

~ Breastfeed as often as the child wants

## Follow-Up

PlanWhen child is discharged, make a follow-up plan until full recovery, with the appropriate clinic (e.g., OPD, nutrition clinic or local health worker/clinic).

~ Weigh the child weekly after discharge
~ If child fails to gain weight over 2 weeks, loses weight between 2 measurements, develops loss of appetite or oedema, refer child back to hospital for a full reassessment Monitor child periodically after discharge from the nutritional programme to prevent relapse: at 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months; then twice a year until when the child is 3 years old

## 19.2.3 Sam In Infants Less Than 6 Months

SAM in infants <6 months is rare. An organic cause or failure to thrive should be considered and treated. Admit the infant with SAM if any of the following are present:
~ General danger signs or serious condition
~ Recent weight loss or failure to gain weight
~ Ineffective breastfeeding (attachment, positioning, or suckling) directly observed for 15-20 minutes Any pitting bilateral oedema of feet
~ Any medical problem needing more assessment
~ Any social issue needing detailed assesssment or intensive support e.g depression of caretaker

TREATMENT
Initial Phase Admit child Give parenteral antibiotics to treat possible sepsis and appropriate treatment for other medical complications Re-establish effective breastfeeding by mother or give infant formula, safely prepared and used In infants with SAM and oedema, give infant formula (preferably) 
or if not available, F-75 or diluted F-100 (use 1.5 litres instead of 1 litre)
 For infants with SAM and NO oedema, give expressed breast milk; if not possible, give commercial infant formula, F-75 or diluted F-100 in this order of preference Assess the physical and mental health of mothers or caretakers. 

Provide relevant treatment and support TREATMENT
Discharge
~ Infants can be transferred to outpatient care if:
- All clinical conditions, medical complications and oedema are resolved, or if child is clinically well and alert
- Child is breastfeeding effectively or feeding well - Weight gain is satisfactory, e.g., above median WHO 
growth velocity standards or >5 g/kg per day for 3 successive days
~ Before discharge, verify immunisation status, link mothers and caregivers with community follow-on support and ensure that child is breastfeeding well, has an adequate weight gain and has WFL ³-2 Z scores

## 19.2.4 Obesity And Overweight Icd10 Code: E66

Overweight and obesity are an abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health. It is a risk factor for many diseases and is linked to many deaths. Body mass index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height used to classify overweight and obesity in adults.

BMI = Weight (in kilograms)
 Height (in metres) squared (m2)

In children, age needs to be considered when defining overweight and obesity

## Causes

~ High energy (i.e. calorie) intake: eating too much, eating a lot of fatty food
~ Low expenditure of energy: sedentary lifestyle, no exercise or limited activity
~ Disease: hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, pituitary cancer

## Raised Bmi Is A Major Risk Factor For:

~ Cardiovascular disease: heart disease and stroke ~ Diabetes mellitus
~ Musculoskeletal disorders: osteoarthritis
~ Some cancers: endometrial, breast, ovarian, prostate, liver, kidney, gallbladder, kidney
~ Obstructive sleep apnoea ~ Fatty liver, gallstones

## Clinical Features

 Overweight Difficulty breathing Poor sleeping patterns Joint damage due to weight Low fertility Poor self-image, antisocial, depression In children, also increased risk of fractures, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance Investigations Blood pressure Blood glucose Cholesterol Management

## Prevention And Health Education

~ Society and community choices: make healthier food the most accessible, available, and affordable food, and regular physical activity

## ~ Individuals Should:

- Limit energy intake from total fats and sugars: reduce fatty meat, palm cooking oil (replace with sunflower, olive, corn oil)
- Increase consumption of fruits and vegetables, as well as - legumes, whole grains and nuts - Engage in regular physical activity (60 minutes a day for children and 150 minutes spread through the week for adults)
- Stop other habits that increase risk of non-communicable - diseases, e.g., tobacco smoking, alcohol abuse

## 20.2.2 Glaucoma Icd10 Code: H40

 
Glaucoma is a group of disorders characterised by a loss of visual field associated with cupping of the optic disc and optic nerve damage. Although glaucoma is associated with raised intra-ocular pressure (IOP), it can also occur when this pressure is within the normal range.

Glaucoma is classified as either open-angle or angle-closure glaucoma. Primary open-angle glaucoma is the most common.

Risk factors for open-angle glaucoma
~ Older age, black people, family history, genetics
~ Vascular dys-regulation (migraine, vasospasm, abnormalities in ocular blood flow), low ocular perfusion pressure, diabetes 
~ Ocular factors: Raised intra-ocular pressure, myopia, central corneal thickness - thinner corneas associated with increased risk

Open angle glaucoma
~ Mostly asymptomatic
~ History of gradual loss of vision in affected eye or loss of visual field
~ Often suspected after seeing cupping of optic disc on routine fundoscopy or finding elevated intra-ocular pressure on screening

## Angle-Closure Glaucoma

~ Sudden onset of severe eye pain and redness, associated with nausea, vomiting and headache
~ Loss of vision in the affected eye ~ Coloured halos or bright rings around lights
~ Hazy-looking cornea
~ Fixed, semi-dilated pupil ~ Shallow anterior chamber
~ Severely elevated IOP. When palpated with a finger, the affected eye feels hard, compared to the other eye
~ If IOP rises more slowly, the patient may be asymptomatic with gradual loss of vision

~ Goal of treatment is to arrest/delay progress of the disease, not for visual improvement. Therapy is usually life long
~ Angle-closure glaucoma is a medical emergency that requires urgent reduction of intra ocular pressure Refer all suspects to specialist

| TREATMENT   | LOC RR   |
|-------------|----------|
| Open-angle glaucoma ‰ Timolol 0.5% eye drops given 1 drop 12 hourly ‰ Angle-closure glaucoma (acute) ‰ For urgent reduction of IOP, give mannitol 20% by  slow IV infusion until IOP is reduced ‰ Reduce intracocular pressure with acetazolamide tablets  500 mg single dose followed by 250 mg every 6 hours ‰ Plus timolol 0.5% drops 1 drop 12 hourly Caution ƒ Avoid timolol eye drops in patients with asthma, heart  block and uncontrolled heart failure             |          |

## 20.2.3 Diabetic Retinopathy Icd10 Code: E10.31, E11.31

A disease in which small blood vessels are damaged due elevated blood sugar over a prolonged period of time.

Risk factors for Diabetic Retinopathy
~ Longer duration and poor control of diabetes
~ Hypertension, kidney diseases ~ Pregnancy (associated with rapid disease progression)
~ High Body mass index (BMI), sedentary lifestyle
~ Smoking and alcohol use

~ Patients can present either with a sudden painless loss of vision or gradual and progressive loss of vision. It may also be discovered on routine examination

| Hyperopia,  long-sightedness  or far-sightedness,  also termed hy - permetropia can  be physiological  (axial or refractive)  or pathological  (mal-development,  anatomical or  drug-induced) in  nature. Myopia,  short-sightedness  or near-sightedness  It can be simple  (length and power),  pathological/de - generative (mal-de - velopment or anatomical) in  nature, induced or  pseudomyopia. Presbyopia It is an age-related  visual impairment.  It results from the  gradual decrease  in accommodation  expected with  age and can have  multiple effects on  quality of vision  and quality of life. |          |                                                                                    | Blurred  distance  vision                             |

## 20.2.5 Low Visio Icd10 Code: H54

This is a loss of eyesight that makes everyday tasks difficult. A person with low vision finds it difficult or impossible to accomplish activities such as reading, watching television, driving a car or recognizing faces. When vision cannot be improved with regular eyeglasses, medicine or surgery, people with low vision need rehabilitation to learn how to make the most of their remaining sight and keep their independence.

Classification patterns of vision loss include:

| Central vision    | This is the detailed vision we use when we look directly at  something. Age-related Macular degeneration (AMD) affects  central vision. Diabetic retinopathy can affect central or  peripheral vision                                      |
| Peripheral vision | This is the less detailed vision we use to see everything  around the edges. Glaucoma affects peripheral vision first.  Strokes can affect one side of the peripheral vision This is the ability to distinguish between objects of similar |
| Contrast sensitivity                   | tones like milk in a white cup or to distinguish facial features. All eye problems  can decrease contrast sensitivity                                                                                                                      |
| Depth perception  | This is the ability to judge the position of objects. New vision  loss in one eye can affect depth perception, such as the  height of a step                                                                                               |
| Visual processing | The lens in our eye focuses light rays onto our retina. The  retina converts these light rays into signals that are sent  through the optic nerve to our brain, where they are interpreted as the images we see. A problem with any of these  processes affects our vision in various ways                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Fungal infection usually confined to the mucous membranes and external layers of skin. Severe forms are usually associated with immunosuppressive conditions, such as HIV/AIDS, diabetes, pregnancy, cancer, prolonged antibiotic use, and steroids.

Common foreign bodies (FB) include:
~ Insects (flies, cockroaches, ants), seeds, beads, stones
~ Children: Usually insert the FB themselves, or their peers may do it
~ Adults: Usually insects, cotton buds
~ Occasionally the FB may penetrate adjacent parts and lodge in the middle ear

## 21.2 Nasal Conditions

21.2.1 Foreign Body in the Nose ICD10 CODE: T17.0 Usually occurs in children <5 years Causes
~ Seeds, e.g., bean, peas, ground nut
 
~ Paper, foam rubber (e.g., mattress foam)
~ Beads, stones, metal objects

~ Usually inserted by the child, and therefore mostly found in the right-hand nasal cavity
~ Foreign body noticed by child/parent May be visible or felt Sharp object may cause bleeding
~ Unilateral foul-smelling discharge from the nose Differential diagnosis
~ Infection in the nose, sinuses, or adenoids Investigations Usually not required (Clinical diagnosis is enough)
 X-rays may be helpful in case of metallic objects like wires or ball bearings

Prevention
~ Caution children about placing objects in mouth, nose, and ears 21.2.2 Epistaxis (Nose Bleeding) ICD10 CODE: R04.0 Bleeding from the nostrils, which may be arterial or venous Causes
~ Local: nose-picking, trauma, nose infections, tumours
~ General: hypertension, bleeding disorders, pertussis, Sickle-cell trait/disease, renal failure, often familial
~ Can also be a symptom of serious disease, e.g., typhoid, malaria, viral fevers such as Ebola

~ On examination, site of bleeding from nose may be seen
~ Signs and symptoms of shock if bleeding is severe ~ Signs and symptoms of predisposing cause

~ Clinical assessment to exclude any of above causes Investigations Blood: Full blood count, platelet count CHAPTER 21 : **Ear, Nose & Throat Conditions**

~ Treat/eliminate known causes, such as syphilis 21.2.6 Adenoid Disease ICD10 CODE: J35.02, J35.2 Enlargement/inflammation of nasopharyngeal tonsil. Common in small children.

May be due to enlargement, inflammation, or both
~ Obstruction of the nose leading to mouth breathing, difficulty eating, snoring, jaw deformities
~ Obstruction of Eustachian tube leading to hearing loss, which fluctuates due to fluid in middle ear ("Glue ear")
~ Recurrent otitis
~ Discharge from the nose
~ Recurrent cough ~ Physical and other developmental retardation, e.g. small size for age

 Diagnosis is usually based on history X-ray for neck soft tissue: lateral view shows narrowing of the post-nasal space

## 21.3 Throat Conditions

21.3.1 **Foreign Body (FB) in the Airway** ICD10 CODE: T17 Mostly occurs in children <5 years Cause
~ Types of FBs include seeds (groundnuts, beans, maize) plastics, rubber, metal wires, ball bearings
~ Usually inhaled from the mouth
~ Child is chewing, laughing, or crying or there is a sudden disturbance, which opens the vocal cords so the object is inhaled

~ Sudden onset of choking followed by stridor (noisy breathing) or
~ Cough, difficulty in breathing, wheezing
~ Hoarseness of voice if FB stuck at the vocal cords
~ Symptoms start suddenly, some symptoms may be transient (may disappear after a short period), but complications may present few days later (sudden death, intractable pneumonia)
~ Upper airway obstruction as shown by: flaring of the nostrils, recession of the chest inlet and/or below the ribs, rapid chest movements and reduced air entry (usually on the right side)

 Once the history and examination are suggestive, investigations can be omitted to save time Chest x-ray may show lung collapse, hyperinflation, mediastinal shift, shift of heart shadow

21.3.2 Foreign Body in the Food Passage ICD10 CODE: T18

~ Types of FBs commonly involved include:
 Fish or chicken bones, often lodging in the tonsils, behind the tongue, or in the pharynx, occasionally in the oesophagus
~ Coins, especally in children. Coins are particularly likely to be ingested. Disc battery is particularly dangerous and requires immediate referral

~ Difficulty and pain in swallowing Patient winces as he attempts to swallow
~ Drooling of saliva
~ Patient may point to where foreign body is stuck with a finger 
(pointing sign)
~ FB may be seen, e.g., in tonsil, pharynx Differential diagnosis
~ Infection in pharynx
~ Trauma by foreign body
~ Medication ulcer (e.g. doxycycline)

 X-ray may reveal radio-opaque FB
 Coins may appear on X-rays done for other reasons Many FBs are radiolucent Look for a gas shadow if in the oesophagus
 

~ The approach depends upon the type of object ingested, the location of the object, and the patient's clinical status.

~ If negative radiographs, no symptoms and the FB does not belong to a dangerous category (magnets, disc batteries, sharp long objects, superabsorbent polymer), expectant management is advised.

~ If patient is symptomatic and/or the object is dangerous, immediate referral for further management.

## 22.2.2 Herpes Zoster (Shingles) Icd10 Code: B02

An acute cutaneous infection involving primarily the dorsal root ganglia, usually of a single dermatome. It is characterised by a vesicular eruption in areas supplied by peripheral sensory nerves in the affected root ganglia.

 Varicella zoster virus, usually reactivated from the virus that entered the cutaneous nerves during an earlier episode of chicken pox and remained in a latent form. This usually occurs during low immunity.

- For chickenpox, see section 2.3.2

~ Pre-eruptive pain, itching or burning: generally localized to the dermatome, precedes the eruption by 4-5 days
~ The above are followed by characteristic crops of very painful vesicles on the side supplied by affected nerve
~ Mild chills, fever, malaise Differential diagnosis
~ Chicken pox

## 22.4 Parasitic Skin Infections 22.4.1 Scabies Icd10 Code: B86

Contagious skin disease associated with severe itch Cause
~ A parasitic mite, Sarcopterus scabiei hominis
~ Transmitted by direct skin contact with infected person
 

~ Intense itching, especially at night ~ Wheals, papules, vesicles, and thread-like burrows Common in flexural areas, i.e., wrists and inter-digital creases, axillae, nipples, buttocks, and genitalia
~ Scratching spreads mites to other areas leading to widespread, intensely pruritic eruption
~ Secondary infection is common

## Differential Diagnosis

~ Papular urticaria, atopic or seborrhoeic dermatitis
~ Drug eruptions
~ Onchocerciasis ~ Contact dermatitis

 Microscopic identification of mites - diagnosis is largely clinical, their eggs or faeces obtained from the vesicles or mite burrows.

## 22.5.4 Psoriasis Icd10 Code: L40

A chronic recurrent skin disease characterized by scaling, reddened papules or plaques on the scalp, back of the elbows and front of the knees. 

Psoriasis commonly affects skin and joints plus nails.

The lesions tend to appear at sites of trauma (Koebner's reaction).

~ Unknown, but usually genetically transmitted
~ About 30% of cases have a family history

~ Usually in patients 25-40 years old
~ Gradual onset of distinct, red scaling papules which coalesce to form plaques
~ Adherent, silvery white scales, which reveal bleeding points when removed (Ausiptz sign)
~ Worsening psoriasis may lead to total erythroderma
~ Extra articular feature, e.g., pitting or thickening of nail plate with accumulation of debris under the nail plate
 
Differential diagnosis
~ Fungal infection, lichen planus ~ Mycosis fungoides
~ Seborrhoeic dermatitis
~ Medicine-induced eruptions Investigations Diagnosis is largely clinical KOH microscopy to exclude fungal infection Blood: Serum uric acid, rheumatoid factor, and anti- nuclear factor and histology to rule out other diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, skin malignancies etc.

## 22.7 Drug-Induced Skin Reactions

22.7.1 Steven-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) ICD10 CODE: L51 A life threatening hypersensitivity reaction that affects the skin and the mucous membranes: SJS affects up to 10% of the body surface area, while TEN affects >30%. If it is between 10 and 30%, it is SJS/TEN overlap.

CHAPTER 22 : **Skin Diseases**

Most well-known causes are:
~ Certain medications such as: HIV medication (nevirapine), Anti-TB medications, anticonvulsants, e.g., carbamazepine, lamotrigine, sulpha-containg drugs (e.g., co-trimoxazole, allopurinol)
~ Infections, especially in immunocompromised persons

~ Dark macular skin rash, progressing to confluence with epidermal necrosis and large flaccid blisters which rupture, leaving large areas of denuded skin
~ Usually sparing the scalp but involving mucosa (genitalia, mouth, anal area, eyes) with multiple erosions
~ General lanning: fever, malaise
~ Complications: dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, hypoalbuminemia, secondary infection and sepsis

 Diagnosis is usually clinical History of medicines taken Serology for HIV, if status unknown RFTs, pus swab, C&S if indicated

## 23.1.2. **Dentin Hypersensitivity** Icd10 Code: K03.9

This condition is due to wearing off of the enamel, making it thinner leading to exposure of the dentin Causes
~ Gum recession due to age or improper tooth brushing
~ Acidic beverages that cause enamel erosion and dentin exposure
~ Tooth grinding ~ Chipped or fractured tooth may also expose the dentine
~ Eating disorders, e.g. bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa (exposure to vomitus)

~ Sensitivity to hot, cold, sweet or very acidic foods and drinks, and breathing in cold air

## 23.1.3. **Malocclusion** Icd10 Code: M26.4

Malocclusion is any deviation from the normal relation of the teeth in the same arch to each other, and to the teeth in the opposite arch Causes
~ Aetiology is usually multifactorial
~ Discrepancies in the craniofacial skeleton, dentition, or both

## Cases That Require Treatment

~ The main indications for orthodontic treatment are aesthetics and function.

~ Crossbites (as associated occlusal interferences may predispose to Temporomandibular Pain Dysfunction Syndrome)
~ Deep traumatic overbite with palatal impingement of the mandibular incisors
~ Large overjets (increased risk of trauma), severe crowding (as this reduces periodontal support for teeth)
~ While severe malocclusion can have a psychologically debilitating effect, it is often influenced by social and cultural factors

## 23.1.4. **Fluorosis (Mottling)** Icd10 Code: K003

Brown discolouration of teeth Cause
~ Occurs due to long-term excess of fluoride. Endemic in areas of high fluoride occurring naturally in the water.

~ Varies from white opacities to severe pitting and discolouration due to incorporation of the excess fluoride in the enamel structure

## 23.1.5. **False Teeth ("Ebinnyo")**

Traditional beliefs in many Ugandan communities attribute diarrhoea, fever, and vomiting in children to the developing dentition with the belief that if the offending teeth or "ebinnyo" are not removed, the child will die. 

## Facts On Ebinyo

~ The practice of extraction of ebinnyo/false teeth is based on the belief that rubbing of herbs on the gum (in the region of the canine), or the removal of the primary and/ or permanent canine tooth buds will lead to the relief of childhood fevers and diarrhoea, The procedure is done as early as 1 month and up to 3 years of age. Most studies report a peak age of 4-18 months
~ Whereas infant illnesses may be attributed to the teething period, they are in fact a result of the poor health conditions in which these children are raised
~ The term ebinyo encompasses both the child's ailment, as well as the treatment offered by traditional healers Consequences of traditional treatment of ebinyo
~ The procedure is aimed at removal of the primary canine, but damage to the surrounding tissues occurs
~ The incisions in the mouth and the herbs can lead to oral sepsis, bacteraemia, anaemia, and death
~ If initial cause of diarrhoea, fever, and vomiting is not addressed, dehydration and death can occur
~ Depending on the extent of damage, malocclusion can result because the permanent canine maybe missing, impacted, or malformed

## 23.2 Oro-Dental Infections

23.2.1. Prevention of Dental Caries and Other Conditions Due to Poor Oral lannin
~ Advise patient to reduce sugary foods and soft drinks, and to have adequate fresh fruit and vegetables in their diet
~ Advise patient to brush their teeth at least twice a day (morning and evening) or preferably after every meal (wait at least 30 minutes if you have consumed acidic food like lemon, oranges, grapes)
~ Dental flossing at least once a day
~ Tooth strengthening and protection by rinsing with fluoride rinses and applying sealants to susceptible sites on teeth
~ Prevention and early management of dental caries ~ Advise patient to have a dental check-up every six months
~ Good nutrition

## 23.2.2 Dental Caries Icd10 Code: K02

Sugar-dependent disease resulting into cavities or holes in the teeth.

~ Poor oral hygiene results in bacteria accumulation in a plaque on the tooth surface. Acid produced as a by-product of metabolism of dietary carbohydrate by the plaque bacteria causes demineralization and disintegration of the tooth surface forming a cavity

~ Localized toothache ~ Cavitations in the teeth
~ Tooth sensitivity to hot and cold stimuli
~ Susceptible sites include pits and fissures of the posterior teeth, interproximal surfaces, and teeth in malocclusion

## Differential Diagnosis

## 23.2.6. **Acute Necrotizing Ulcerative Gingivitis (Anug)/Periodontitis/Stomatitis** Icd10 Code: A69.0-1

Also known as Vincent's gingivitis or Vincent's gingivostomatitis. They are infections characterized by oral ulcerations and necrosis.

Gingivitis only affects the gums, periodontitis involves the surrounding tissue and attaching the teeth.

In stomatitis, there is widespread involvement of mucosa and bone loss, until the most severe form known as noma or cancrum oris, leading to 
 
extensive destruction of facial tissues and bones. Inadequately treated ANUG will lapse into a less symptomatic form known as chronic ulcerative gingivitis.

~ Fusospirochaetal complex together with gram negative anaerobic organisms

## Predisposing Factors

~ Associated with poor oral hygiene, stress and smoking
~ Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, and debilitated patients with poor hygiene
~ Malnutrition
~ HIV infection

~ Swelling and erythema of the gingival margins, which bleed easily when touched, causing difficulty drinking and eating
~ Painful papillary yellowish-white ulcers
~ Necrosis and sloughing of gum margins
~ Loss of gingiva and support bone around teeth ~ Foul smelling breath
~ Patient complains of metallic taste and the sensation of their teeth being wedged apart
~ Fever, malaise, and regional lymphadenitis may be present ~ Extensive destruction of the face and jaws in the severe form of Cancrum Oris or noma (in malnourished patients)

## Differential Diagnosis

~ Dental abscess
~ Swelling due to trauma
~ Acute stomatitis CHAPTER 23 : **Oral and Dental Conditions**
~ Oral thrush
~ Chemical oral ulcers

## 23.2.12.Osteomyelitis Of The Jaw Icd10 Code: M27.2

Inflammation of the medullary portion of the jaw bone which extends to involve the periosteum of the affected area. Infection in the bone ends up with pus formation in the medullary cavity or beneath the periosteum, and obstructs the blood supply. The infected bone becomes necrotic following ischaemia.

Initial stage
~ Malaise and fever; there is no swelling ~ Enlargement of regional lymphnodes
~ Teeth in affected area become painful and loose, thus causing difficulty in chewing CHAPTER 23 : **Oral and Dental Conditions**
Later stage
~ Bone undergoes necrosis and area becomes very painful and swollen
~ Pus ruptures through the periosteum into the muscular and subcutaneous fascia. Eventually it is discharged on to the skin surface through a sinus

## Investigations

 X-ray- Orthopantomograph (OPG) will show characteristic features (e.g., widening of periodontal spaces, changes in bone trabeculation, areas of radiolucency and sequestra formation in chronic stage)
 Culture and sensitivity of pus

## Prevention

~ Early orthodontic treatment in children with large overjets that are susceptible to trauma
~ Provision of a mouth guard (made of vacuum formed thermo- plastic vinyl) for sports
~ Be alert for evidence of child abuse and notify relevant authorities if any.

## 23.5 Oral Tumours 23.5.1 Burkitt'S Lymphoma Icd10 Code: C83.7

Burkitt's lymphoma (or "Burkitt's tumour" or "Malignant lymphoma, Burkitt's type") is a cancer of the lymphatic system (in particular, B lymphocytes). It is a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and recognised as the fastest growing human tumour. Of all cancers involving the same class of blood cell, 2% of cases are Burkitt's lymphoma.

Causes
~ Associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
Risk factors
~ HIV/AIDS ~ Chronic malaria ~ Low socio-economic status

Often presents as a tooth ache in the maxilla Teeth are mobile Extractions do not relieve the swelling Peak incidence at 4-7 years of age and more common among boys

## Classification

Burkitt's lymphoma is divided into 3 main clinical variants:
~ Endemic variant: occurs in malaria endemic areas. Chronic malaria is believed to reduce resistance to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), 
which is usually linked with the disease. The disease characteristically involves the jaw or other facial bone, distal ileum, caecum, ovaries, kidney, or the breast.

~ Sporadic type: (also known as ""non-African") is usually found outside of Africa
~ Immunodeficiency-associated Burkitt's lymphoma: usually associated with HIV infection or in post- transplant patients taking immunosuppressive drugs. Burkitt's lymphoma can be the initial manifestation of AIDS.

## Differential Diagnosis ~ Other Cancer Diseases

Investigations
~ Biopsy of the mass Management

## 24.1 Surgery 24.1.1 Intestinal Obstruction Icd10 Code: K56

Interruption of the normal flow of intestinal content, due to mechanical obstruction (at small or large bowel level), or due to functional paralysis.

## Causes

~ Small bowel mechanical obstruction: tumours, adhesions from previous surgeries or infections
~ Large bowel obstructions: tumours, volvolus, adhesions, inflammatory strictures (e.g. diverticulosis, etc.)

## Clinical Features

~ Small bowel obstruction: cramping abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal distention. Due to the accumulation of fuids into the dilated intestinal loops, there is usually a varying degree of dehydration
~ Large bowel obstruction: bloating, abdominal pain, constipation, vomiting and nausea less frequent and mainly in proximal colon obstruction; signs of dehydration and shock come later.

## Investigations

 Abdominal X-ray (erect or left lateral decubitus, for air- fluid level), 
see section 24.2.1 for details

## Differential Diagnosis

~ Paralytic ileus (diffuse functional paralysis of small and large bowel due to drugs, biochemical abnormalities, abdominal infections etc)

## 24.1.2 Internal Haemorrhage

Internal bleeding (also called internal haemorrhage) is a loss of blood that occurs from the vascular system into a body cavity or space. It is a serious medical emergency and the extent of severity depends on:
 Bleeding rate (hypovolaemic shock)
 Location of the bleeding (damage to organs, even with relatively limited amounts: see specific chapters)
Severe bleeding in a body cavity/space is an emergency condition with unstable vital signs (e.g., ruptured spleen, ruptured tubal pregnancy)

24.1.3 Management of Medical Conditions in Surgical Patient

## Principle

The medical condition must be stabilised as much as possible before surgery.

Pre-operative management
~ Establish whether condition is stable or unstable ~ If unstable, control or correct the condition CHAPTER 24 : **Surgery, Radiology and Anaesthesia**
Operative and post-operative management
~ Anaesthesia technique based on condition and nature of surgery ~ Maintain the stable condition

## 24.1.4 **Newborn With Surgical Emergencies**

Babies may be born at lower health facilities with congenital defects that require emergency surgical intervention at tertiary levels:
- The common surgical emergencies in neonates include: 
gastroschisis (defect of abdominal wall with intestine sticking outside the body), tracheoesophageal fistula, imperforate anus, and spina bifida
- If diagnosed in lower level health facilities (HCII, HCIII, HCIV, 
District Hospital), apply general principles of supportive management of the newborn The aim should be to avoid hypothermia, inimize risk of infection, ensure adequate hydration, and inimize risk of aspiration and hypoglycaemia

## 24.1.5 Surgical Antibiotic Prophylaxis

This is the pre-operative administration of antibiotics to reduce the risk of surgical site infection.

## General Principles

~ The need of prophylaxis depends on the nature of the expected wound
- Wounds that are expected to be clean (no inflammation, - And respiratory, genital, urinary and alimentary tract not entered) generally DO NOT require prophylaxis except where the consequences of surgical site infection could be severe (e.g., joint replacements)
- Prophylaxis is indicated in cases of clean-contaminated wounds (entering respiratory, genital, urinary and alimentary tracts but no unusual contamination)
- Treatment with a course of antibiotics is indicated in - procedures with contaminated wounds (fresh open accidental wounds, operations with major breaks in sterile techniques), dirty or infected wounds (old traumatic wounds with retained necrotic tissue, clinical infection, perforated viscera)
~ Prophylaxis is given <60 minutes before the first incision
~ Refer to institution-specific protocols for details

## Chapter 24 : Surgery, Radiology And Anaesthesia

Prophylaxis is not recommended for most uncomplicated clean procedures One single dose prior to the procedure is usually sufficient Routine post-operative antimicrobial administration is NOT recommended for most surgeries as it causes wastage of limited resources, causes unnecessary side effects to the patient and can lead to antimicrobial resistance.

## 24.2 Diagnostic Imaging 24.2.1 Diagnostic Imaging: A Clinical Perspective

Medical imaging is an essential part of the diagnosis of many diseases. A diagnostic imaging procedure is indicated when the management of a patient depends on the findings of the procedure. Therefore, before any diagnostic imaging procedure is requested, the question of how the results will influence patient management and care should always be asked.

~ Prior to requesting a procedure, it is useful to determine if the required information is already available from recent procedures, and if the relevant clinical, laboratory, diagnostic imaging, and treatment information is provided.

~ When indicated and available, alternative diagnostic imaging procedures which do not use ionising radiation, e.g. ultrasound, should be chosen first, especially in children.

Questions to be answered to prevent unnecessary use of procedure and radiation
~ Has this procedure been done already? ~ Does the patient need it?

~ Does the patient need it NOW?

~ Is this the best procedure? ~ Are all the investigations I am requesting necessary?

~ Have you provided appropriate clinical information and questions that the procedure should answer?

1044 No procedure should ever be requested in lieu of a thorough clinical assessment or as a means of satisfying a difficult patient.

Basic Diagnostic Imaging Modalities Plain Radiography (Hospital)
 Ultrasound scan (HC4 and Hospital)
- Ultrasound is non-invasive and does not use ionising radiation. 

Therefore, when indicated, it is the most appropriate imaging modality for children and pregnant women.

Other imaging modalities (at RR and NR)
~ Computed tomography
~ Fluoroscopy
~ Magnetic Resonance Imaging
~ Nuclear Medicine ~ Mammography In the following table, a summary of the clinical indication, the suggested investigation modality and the possible findings are presented, as a guide to request the correct investigation based on the clinical suspicion. Note CT scan is the investigation of choice for intracranial pathological processes (severe head trauma, stroke, etc.) but it is only available at referral facilities.

Types of Anaesthesia Anaesthesia may be produced in a number of ways General anaesthesia
~ Basic elements: Loss of consciousness, analgesia, prevention of undesirable reflexes, and muscle relaxation Regional or local anaesthesia
~ Sensation of pain is blocked without loss of consciousness. The conduction of stimulus from a painful site to the brain can be interrupted at one of the many points:
 Surface anaesthesia Infiltration anaesthesia Intravenous regional anaesthesia Nerve block/plexus block
- Epidural anaesthesia - Spinal anaesthesia

## Preparation In The Operating Theatre Pre-Operative Management

The aim is to make the patient as fit as possible before surgical operation Assessment of the patient
- Identify the patient and establish rapport - A standard history is obtained and an examination done
- Emphasis is on the cardio-respiratory systems
- Investigations appropriately interpreted e.g., Hb - Health status/condition of the patient - Classify physical status of the patient according to A.S.A. 

(ASA classification 1-5 with or without E)
- Make a plan for anaesthesia based on the information obtained Preparation of the patient
- Explain the procedure to the patient and ensure that he/

she has understood
- Ensure informed consent form is signed - Weight of patient should be taken - Check site and side of the operation ![19_image_1.png](19_image_1.png) - Remove: Ornaments/prostheses/dentures that may injure the patient and make-up that may interfere with monitoring
- Any other necessary preparation based on patient's condition and nature of the operation (condition of deficits/ imbalances should be corrected, control chronic conditions)
- Ability of the patient to withstand the stresses and adverse effects of anaesthesia and the surgical procedure will depend on how well prepared he/she is

## 24.3.1.3 Muscle Relaxants

They are used to provide muscle relaxation to facilitate a procedure, and used in a patient who is unconscious, e.g. general anaesthesia, or sedated.

~ Precaution before using a muscle relaxant: always have means of supporting the airway and respiration

## 24.3.3 Selection Of Type Of Anaesthesia For The Patient Consider The Following Factors:

~ Patient factors: medical state, time of last meal, mental state, wish of patient if applicable
~ Surgical factors: nature of surgery, site of operation, estimated duration of surgery, position in which the surgery is to be performed
~ Anaesthetic factors: availability of drugs, experience and competence of the anaesthetic provider

## 24.3.3.1 **Techniques Of General Anaesthesia**

Requirements for all
- Take and record baseline vital signs - Establish intravenous line and commence infusion

| RAPID SEQUENCE INDUCTION OF GENERAL ANAESTHES   | IA   |
|-------------------------------------------------|------|

Induce anaesthesia by:
~ Intravenous route (adults) or ~ Inhalation route (children, patient with difficult airway)
Maintenance
~ Secure a clear airway using an oropharyngeal airway
~ The mask is placed on the face
~ Titrate concentration of inhalation against response of the patient
~ Monitor, record every 5 minutes or more frequently, BP, pulse, respiration, colour, oximetry Indication
~ This technique may be used for operations on limbs, perineum, superficial wall of chest, and abdomen
~ Suitable for operations lasting less than 30 minutes Induce anaesthesia:
~ Intravenous/inhalation (see above)
~ Tracheal intubation
- When spontaneously breathing for anticipated difficult airway (for children) or
- Under relaxation by suxamethonium and laryngoscopy - Confirm correct tube placement by presence of breath sounds on both chest sides
- Connect the breathing/delivery system to the endotracheal tube Maintenance
~ Titrate concentration of inhalation agent against response of the patient
- A selected, long acting muscle relaxant is given - Intermittent positive pressure ventilation is done CHAPTER 24 : **Surgery, Radiology and Anaesthesia**
 
1058 CHAPTER 24 : **Surgery, Radiology and Anaesthesia**

## Rapid Sequence Induction Of General Anaesthesia

- Monitor vital signs (as above)
~ At the end of the operation when the patient shows signs of respiratory effort, give
- IV. Neostigmine 0.03 to 0.07 mg/kg to reverse the - effects of the long acting muscle relaxant Indication
~ All operations that require a protected airway and controlled ventilation, e.g, intraabdominal, intrathoracic, and intracranial operations
(Also called crash induction) For patients with "full stomach" and at risk of regurgitation, e.g., emergency surgery, distended abdomen Crash induction steps
~ Establish an intravenous line and commence infusions
~ Preoxygenation for >3 minutes
~ Induce with selected intravenous anaesthetic agent ~ Assistant applies cricoid pressure
~ IV suxamethonium is given
~ Laryngosopy is done ~ Trachea is intubated and correct tube placement confirmed
~ The cuff of the endotracheal tube is inflated, then cricoid pressure released
~ The position of the tube is fixed by strapping and an airway is inserted
~ Then connect to breathing circuit/system to maintain anaesthesia

## 24.1.1.1 Techniques For Regional Anaesthesia

~ Detailed knowledge of anatomy, technique, and possible complications is important for correct injection placement
~ Preoperative assessment and preparation of the patient should be done
~ Patient refusal and local sepsis are the only absolute contraindications
~ Select the appropriate technique for operation

## Appendix 1 Standard Infection Control Precautions

Transmission of infections in health care facilities can be prevented and controlled through the application of basic infection control precautions which can be grouped into:
~ Standard precautions: basic infection control measures which must be applied to all patients at all times, regardless of diagnosis or infectious status. They are designed to reduce the risk of transmission of micro-organisms from both recognized and non-recognized sources.

~ Additional (transmission-based) precautions: measures that are used for patients known or suspected to be infected or colonized with highly transmissible or epidemiological important pathogens for which additional precautions are needed to interrupt transmission in health care facilities.

For more details please refer to Uganda National Infection Prevention and Control Guidelines December 2013.

## Standard Precautions Hygiene

Personal hygiene Personal Hygiene involves the general cleanliness and care of the whole body: short and clean nails, short or pinned up hair, appropriate clean clothing (uniforms), no jewels on the hands, closed shoes.

## Hand Washing

Hand washing is a major component of standard precautions and one of the most effective methods to prevent transmission of pathogens associated with health care.

![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)

 Before and after any direct patient contact and between patients When any skin area is contaminated with body fluids Before handling an invasive device or doing any procedures (even if gloves will be worn!)
 After removing gloves During patient care, when moving from contaminated to a clean body site of the patient After contact with inanimate objects in the immediate vicinity of the patient.

~ Hand wash (40-60 sec) with water and soap, rub all surfacs, dry with a single use towel or
~ Hand rub (wtih an alcohol based rub) for 20-30 sec, apply enough product to cover all areas of the hands and rub hands until dry

## Respiratory Hygiene And Cough Etiquette

~ Patients with respiratory symptoms should cover their mouth and nose with tissue or mask while coughing/ sneezing, dispose of used tissues and masks and perform hand hygiene after contact with respiratory secretions
~ Patients with respiratory symptoms should be placed 1 metre away from others in waiting areas and hand hygiene, tissues and masks made available in common areas

## Instrument Hygiene (Decontamination)

Decontamination is the combination of processes, including cleaning, APPENDIX
 
disinfection and/or sterilisation used to render a re- useable medical device safe for further episodes of use. The level of decontamination depends on the situation involved and the type and use of equipment.

~ Cleaning is the single most important step in making a medicaldevicereadyforre-use:byremovingorganicmaterial and reducing the number of micro-organisms present, it is an essential prerequisite of equipment decontamination to ensure effective disinfection or sterilization can be subsequently carried out. It utilizes detergents.

~ Disinfection 'is a process used to reduce the number of viable micro-organisms, which may not necessarily inactivate some viruses and bacterial spores. Disinfection will not achieve the same reduction in microbial contamination levels as sterilization. It can be carried out by heat (boiling) or by chemical disinfectants.

~ Sterilization is a process used to render the object free from viable micro-organisms, including spores and viruses. Moist Heat via clean steam (autoclaving) is the method of choice. Chemical disinfection may only be used when autoclaving is not possible.

## Facility Hygiene

A clean environment forms the basis of sound infection prevention and control practices. This is because there is an important link between cleaning of health care facilities and persistence of nosocomial pathogens.

~ The purpose of cleaning the environment is toremove visible dirt, reduce the level of microorganisms and to minimize the dissemination of infectious agents in the facility, thereby providing an aesthetically pleasing, sanitary and relatively contamination –free environment for patients, staff and visitors

## Linen And Laundry

~ Ensure proper handling of linen/laundry Collect clothing/sheets stained with blood/body-fluids while wearing gloves or using a plastic bag and keep separate from other laundry - never touch them directly APPENDIX
 Disinfect with hypochlorite if contaminated with body fluids Wash with soap and boil for 20 minutes

## Personal Protective Equipment (Ppe)

Personal Protective Equipment is specialised clothing or equipment worn to protect someone against a hazard or infection. PPE is indicated when health worker-patient interaction indicates that exposure to blood or body fluids is anticipated. They provide a physical barrier between micro- organism and the person.

## Gloves

~ Wear clean protective gloves when handling body fluids/secretions, mucous membranes, nonintact skin contaminated waste,-
soiled bedding or linen instruments, and for when cleaning body fluid spills
~ Change between tasks and procedures on the same patients after contact with potentially infectious material
~ Remove after use, before touching any other surface, and wash hands immediately
~ Wear sterile or high-level disinfected gloves when performing sterile procedures

## Other Ppe

~ Wear a surgical or procedure mask and eye protection (googles or glasses) or a face shield when performing activities which are likely to generate splashes or sprays of blood, body fluids, secretions or excretions
~ Wear a gown to protect skin and prevent soiling of clothing in activities as above
~ Use a waterproof bandage to cover wounds
~ Wear protective boots and gloves and where possible, wear a water-proof apron when working in a heavily contaminated area, e.g., toilets
 
~ Avoid mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and pipetting by mouth where possible
~ In surgical procedures, use a needle holder and appropriate sized needle, wear double gloves and eye shield

## Safe Handling Of Sharps

~ Ensure safe sharps handling and disposal
~ Avoid accidental pricks and cuts with contaminated sharp instruments (e.g., needles) by careful handling and proper disposal
~ Use "hands-free" technique for passing sharp instruments ~ Keep a puncture-resistant container nearby
~ Use safe injection practices:
- Use a sterile needle and syringe for every injection - Do not recap, bend, or break needles after use
~ Drop all used disposable needles, plastic syringes, and blades directly into the sharps container without recapping or passing to another person
~ Empty or send for incineration when container is full

## Safe Waste Disposal

~ Separate hazardous (potentially dangerous) from non- hazardous 
(routine) waste
- Hazardous waste includes: infectious waste (e.g. soiled bandages), anatomical waste (placenta), sharps, chemical and pharmaceutical waste
~ Use adequate personal protective equipment when handling hazardous waste (boots, gown, water proof apron, gloves, face protection)
~ Practice safe waste disposal as per guidelines (incineration, burying)

## Additional Precautions

These are necessary for patients who are known or suspected to be 1066 APPENDIX
infected or colonized with specific pathogens that are transmitted by airborn, droplet or contact route of transmission.

## Airborn Precautions

Airborn precautions are designed to prevent transmission of particles < 5 micron in size (e.g. some viruses like measles or chickenpox, M. tubeculosis)
~ Placement of a patient in a well ventilated room with door closed and discharge of air outdoors
~ Use of appropriate respirators (masks with high filtration power) 
when entering the room
~ Limitation of contacts (visitors)
~ Use of surgical mask for the patient if leaving the room
~ Adherence to cough etiquette by the patient
~ In particular settings, negative air pressure an be created

## Droplet Precautions

They are designed to prevent transmission of pathogens transmitted by droplets, released by talking, sneezing and coughing: H. Influenza, N.meningitis, some viruses, pertussis, influenza etc.

~ Place patient in well ventilated room or at least 1 metre distance from other patients
~ Wear a mask if within 1 metre from the patient
~ Patient to wear a mask when moving.

 Closed door and negatve air pressure are not necessary

## Contact Precautions

These precautions are designed to reduce the transmission of organism from an infected or colonized patient through direct or indirect contact. It applies to microorganisms like HIV, hepatitis B, multi-drug resistant 

## 1067

bacteria like MRSA, herpes simplex, varicella and haemorrhagic fevers viruses, skin staphylococcal infections, scabies, lice, other wound infections.

~ Appropriate barrier method must be used
~ Isolate patient, use dedicated equipment if possible
~ Wear gloves before entering the room, change gloves after contact with potentially infected material
~ Remove gloves as soon as leaving the room and wash hands with an antimicrobial
~ Wear a gown if necessary
~ Minimize patient's movements outside the room

## In Case Of Blood Borne Pathogens (Hiv, Hepatitis B)

~ Use particular precautions in taking blood samples
~ Decontaminate any body fluid/blood spillage with 0.5/1% hypochlorite solutions Patients suspected of having hemorrhagic fevers require the strictest infection control procedures (see WHO, 2016. Clinical management of patients with viral hemorrhagic fever. http://www.who.int/csr/resources/ publications/clinical- management-patients/en/)

## Post-Exposure Prophylaxis

Accidental exposure to blood during medical procedures (needle or other sharp injury, splashes of blood on mucosae) carries the risk of transmission of HIV and/or hepatitis B.

Immunization against hepatitis B is recommended in health workers as an effective protection measure.

Steps for post exposure prophylaxis are described in section 3.1.11.1

## Appendix 2 Pharmacovigilance And Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting

Pharmacovigilance and Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Pharmacovigilance is defined as the science and activities relating to the detection, assessment, understanding and prevention of adverse effects or any other drug-related problem.

The aims of pharmacovigilance are to enhance patient care and patient safety in relation to the use of medicines; and to support public health programmes by providing reliable, balanced information for the effective assessment of the risk- benefit profile of medicines.

Any medicine may cause unwanted or unexpected adverse reactions, some of which may be life threatening, for example anaphylactic shock or liver failure.

## Why Should You Report?

Rapid detection and recording of adverse drug reactions (ADR) is of vital importance so that unrecognised hazards are identified promptly and appropriate regulatory action is taken to ensure medicines are used safely and future events are prevented.

## What Should Be Reported

Suspected adverse events to any medicine, vaccines and herbal products should be reported (including self- medication medicines).

Report all adverse drug reactions such as:
~ ADRs to to any medicine (whether new or old)
~ Serious reactions and interactions
~ ADRs which are not clearly stated in the package insert
~ Unusual or interesting adverse drug reactions
~ All adverse reactions or poisonings to traditional or herbal remedies Report Product Quality Problems such as:
~ Suspected contamination
~ Questionable stability
~ Defective components
~ Poor packaging or labelling ~ Therapeutic failures
~ Non-adherence (may be due to product characteristic)
Report medication errors such as:
~ Prescribing errors ~ Dispensing errors
~ Medicine preparation error
~ Administration errors
~ Monitoring error

## Who Should Report?

~ All health workers
~ Patients ~ Any member of the public
~ Medical representatives
~ Pharmaceutical Companies, Distributors, Wholesalers and Retailers

## Where And How To Report

Health workers are urged to immediately report suspected ADRs directly to the National Drug Authority Pharmacovigilance Centre using the ADR forms (see example at the end of this section). The forms can 
 
 
APPENDIX
also be obtained from the regional pharmacovigilance centres. Encourage your patients to report suspected ADRs to you.

ADRs can also be reported directly online using the following links:
~ www.nda.or.ug
~ https://primaryreporting.who-umc.org/Reporting/ Reporter?OrganizationID=UG ~ All regional referral hospitals have pharmacovigilance coordinators
~ NDA regional offices The following NDA offices can also be contacted for further information:

## What Will Happen When I Report?

When NDA receives your report, they will assess the likelihood that the suspected adverse reaction is actually due to the medicine, using the WHO causality assessment criteria for deciding on the contribution of the medicine towards the adverse event. Depending on the outcome of the causality assessment, NDA will give feedback in any of the following ways: medicine alerts, media statements, patient information leaflets, newsletters and personal feedback to reporters.

## Prevention Of Adverse Drug Reactions (Adrs)

~ Never use any medicine without a clear indication
~ If a patient is pregnant, do not use a medicine unless it is absolutely necessary
~ Ask the patient if they have any allergies, hypersensitivity or previous reactions to the medicine or to similar medicines
~ Reduce doses when necessary, for example, in the young, the elderly, and if liver or renal disease is present
~ Always prescribe as few medicines as possible
~ Carefully explain dose regimes to patients, especially those on multiple medicines, the elderly, and anyone likely to misunderstand. Check for understanding before patient goes away.

~ Age and liver or kidney disease may affect the way medicines behave in the body so that smaller than usual amounts are needed
~ Ask if patient is taking other medicines including self medication medicines, health supplements, herbal products as interactions can occur
~ If possible, always use medicines with which you are familiar
~ Look out for ADRs when using new or unfamiliar drugs
~ Warn patients about likely adverse effects and advise them on what to do if they occur

## 

~ Give patients on certain prolonged treatments, for example anticoagulants, corticosteroids, and insulin, a small card which they can carry with them giving information about the treatment Note: Please attach additional pages to the ADR reporting form if necessary. Even if you do not know some details in the form, do not be put off reporting the suspected adverse event
# Appendix 3 National Laboratory Test Menu

The test menu was developed by Ministry of Health/Uganda National Health Laboratory Services (UNHLS). It is a list of tests that are available at the specified level of health care. The laboratory system of Uganda is designed to support the minimum health care package for each level of care, with complexity of tests increasing with the level of care. The laboratory test menu has been included in UCG 2023, in order to guide clinicians about the laboratory services available at each level of health care, and where to refer a patient in need of a particular test.
